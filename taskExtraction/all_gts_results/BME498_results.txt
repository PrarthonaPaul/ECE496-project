| Task | Task Percentage | Description | Deadline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Identify user/stakeholder needs through a user-centered approach | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Describe a credible and professionally acceptable approach to “engineering design” | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Summarize and justify design choices in oral and written formats | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Incorporate realistic constraints of medical technology development into engineering design | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Plan and manage engineering activities to within time and budget constraints | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Document an engineering design in a form suitable for clients to continue project | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Develop a functioning engineering prototype of a product or service | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Progress Presentations | 4% | Each progress presentation will consist of 1) three slides to show current work and 2) asana board update to share project management strategy. Presentation duties will be split and team members not presenting will be expected to answer questions. Every member of each team must present twice and provide an answer at least twice (if there is an odd number in a team, accommodations will be made by the instructor). | N/A |
| Design Process (Team meetings and documentation) | 8% | 4 team meetings will be scheduled approximately every 3 weeks with the project supervisor. The main purpose of these meetings is to review progress using each team’s asana board to uncover problems and plan for future events. The discussions and decisions resulting from the asana board and timeline review will be recorded in the meeting minutes and will be submitted to create a living document of your progress through your design project. | N/A |
| TELS Survey & iLEAD Workshop | 3% | There is a workshop dedicated to a reflection of teamwork after the project proposal is due, marked as shown: | Dec 8 |
| Pre-Class Assignments | 5% | The purpose of these short pre-class assignments (PCAs) is to prepare for a synchronous discussion during small and class-wide discussions held during lectures via webcast. Each assignment will be considered complete by submitting it before the class has started or incomplete if submitted after the beginning of each class associated with a PCA. | N/A |
| Project Requirements | 10% | Gathering information about your chosen problem and building an accurate understanding of your healthcare-related need will allow you define what a design must do to be an acceptable solution. Furthermore, you must also be able to find ways to differentiate different designs you create and define what a design should be and/or must be in order to be successful. Your team is responsible for submitting a concise document that communicates the design requirements (specifications) of your stated need. | Oct 30 |
| Project Proposal | 10% | Your team is responsible for drafting a project proposal document that: 1) defines the design problem, 2) proposes possible solutions and selects the most promising design, and 3) provides a plan to carry out the proposed solution. | Dec 4 |
| Design Review and Critique | 5% | Each team will present an overview of their project and show preliminary prototypes created so far. The aim of this presentation is to demonstrate your knowledge of a healthcare need and the problem you have chosen to solve. The team will defend their design and key decisions with the aim to set your team up for building a working prototype during the winter term. This deliverable is an external design review with the project client, sponsor, or healthcare professional that the team has connected with and the project supervisor. | Jan 22 |
| Demonstration Day | 15% | Each team will present their design and demonstrate their final working prototype to the project supervisors and hopefully some of the users you have connected with as well. Consider this presentation as a pitch to investors or a presentation at a design competition where you still need to clearly communicate the need you are addressing and the problem you are offering a solution to. The Focus of this presentation should be proving, with test results, that your design solves the problem you have identified. The most successful teams will be able to demonstrate how their design works and this is best achieved by performing a live demonstration. | Mar 30 |
| Final Report | 40% | Your team must produce a final report that provides enough information for someone to develop your project further. While much of the project proposal can be reused, you are expected to incorporate feedback from your project supervisors and fellow students to demonstrate you have iterated your original goals, ideas, concepts, designs, etc. | Apr 1 |
| Design Notebook (Individual) | N/A | There is no expectation of completing a design notebook. However, it may be that some individuals want to demonstrate design excellence by thinking deeply about their design problem in ways that are not easy to include in the final report (or project proposal). In this case, individual students may choose to submit their design notebook (see Guidelines for Design Notebooks) that may boost their individual grade when the final report is submitted. Likewise, it may be that some individuals do not contribute to a project satisfactorily as judged by documented team feedback and a track record of progress documentation and progress updates. Should this situation occur, an individual grade may be reduced below the team grade when the final report is submitted. | N/A |
