| Capstone Design Project | N/A | All Engineering students must participate in a capstone design project as part of the engineering curriculum. The project involves solving a practical engineering design problem using skills and knowledge developed over three years. Teams are challenged to define the problem, develop candidate designs, select one, fabricate and test it, revise, and present a prototype, demonstrating design objectives. The project starts in the fall and ends in the spring, with regular presentations to a panel for progress checks. | N/A |
| Course Administration | N/A | Students have four class hours per week. One hour is a lecture, and the remaining three are for group meetings, project work, and additional tasks. The course shared drive is the primary repository for all course information, accessible from anywhere on campus. Students are advised to use the shared drive for all course-related files to ensure easy access and collaboration. | N/A |
| Design Communication: Formatting, Conduct, Submission, and Archiving | N/A | During the fall semester, students give three presentations to a review board, and in the spring, they give three additional presentations, including a prototype demonstration, progress update, and final presentation. Reports are due two weeks after each presentation. All formal written communications should be submitted according to the Design Report Template, ensuring a professional appearance and easy content access. | N/A |
| Team Roles | N/A | Each team identifies members to assume specific roles: Leader, Design Communication Editor, Purchaser, Technical Support Detachment (TSD) Liaison, and Safety Officer. The Leader organizes the group and manages the project schedule, serving as the primary liaison between the team and the project customer. The Design Communication Editor reviews reports and presentations for consistency and proofreads for errors. The Purchaser obtains purchase information and submits purchase orders, tracking items and maintaining the team budget. The TSD Liaison reviews shop work requests, ensuring completeness and accuracy, and tracks shop work hours. The Safety Officer ensures adherence to the division safety instruction. | N/A |
| Purchase Orders | N/A | Each team is provided with project funding, with the exact amount determined during the semester. One team member is designated as the purchaser, following a specific process for processing purchase orders. The process includes finding what is needed, obtaining quotes, filling out the purchase card order form, and submitting the order to the TSD purchasing manager. The team mentor should be notified when a purchase order is ready. | N/A |
| Shop Work Requests | N/A | Teams can request parts to be fabricated by TSD. Students must consult with TSD shop supervisors before submitting a part for manufacture. Requests must include a Project Work Request Form and at least one professional engineering drawing. The drawing must have specific features, such as landscape format, three orthographic views, one isometric view, proper scaling, dimensioning, and tolerancing, a completed title block, and other views as required. | N/A |
| Operational Risk Management Assessment | N/A | An Operational Risk Management (ORM) assessment is conducted when an evolution could potentially result in the loss of life, limb, or property. The assessment is written in memorandum format and includes a brief description of the evolution, characterization and description of hazards using a risk matrix, and a description of safeguards to mitigate risks. The project mentor's signature signifies that the evolution has been discussed with team supervisors. | N/A |
| Design Communication Guidance and Rubrics | N/A | Specific guidance is provided for each report, presentation, and deliverable, including purpose, content expectations, and grading rubrics. The rubrics are used to grade the reports and presentations, with point totals used as a guide for teams and mentors. Teams should use the rubrics as guides in addition to consultation with the project mentor and technical expert. | N/A |
| Project Proposal | N/A | The Project Proposal is the initial design communication, defining the problem and outlining what will be undertaken to solve it. It should communicate a specific need, provide background and context, present the problem statement, outline design requirements, and convince the reader that a solution can be achieved in a timely and cost-effective manner. The report should include a title page, executive summary, table of contents, problem definition, need identification, project deliverables, project management, budget, references, and appendices. | N/A |
| Preliminary Design Report | N/A | The purpose of the Preliminary Design Report (PDR) is to document the process of design evaluation and selection. It includes all design concepts, at least one for each team member, and compares them based on predicted performance with regards to the engineering characteristics developed in the Project Proposal. The report builds upon the Project Proposal, with sections on design concepts, concept evaluation and selection, project deliverables, project management, budget, references, and appendices. | N/A |
| Detail Design Report | N/A | The purpose of the Detail Design Report (DDR) is to capture design choices that will result in the first-generation prototype, ready for testing and evaluation. The report includes sections on embodiment design, prototype test plan, project management, budget, references, and appendices. The embodiment design section discusses system or product architecture, configuration design, and detailed process flow. The prototype test plan section outlines test plans for evaluating the top five ECs. The project management section includes a summary table of major, project-specific tasks, dates, and assigned personnel. | N/A |
| TSD Representative Evaluation of Team Performance | N/A | The TSD representative evaluates the team's performance at 6, 12, and 16 weeks. The evaluation includes the frequency and quality of face-to-face interaction, the quality of informal and formal written communication, and the involvement of the students in defining the problem, generating and reviewing design concepts, discussing the feasibility of design concepts, and seeking input on material selection, design for manufacturing, and engineering drawings. | N/A |
| Prototype Demonstration | N/A | The purpose of this assignment is to provide faculty and staff an opportunity to evaluate the team's progress toward project completion by demonstrating their design prototype. The presentation should include a team and project introduction, problem statement, general description of the prototype, description of subsystems, description and demonstration of operation, fabrication/manufacturing, summary of the prototype test plan, and summary of next steps. | N/A |
| Progress Update Report | N/A | The purpose of the Progress Update Report (PUR) is to provide a formal opportunity for reflection and to capture the team's progress, summarize what they plan to do with the remaining time, and plan out how they will do it. The report focuses on the execution of the Prototype Test Plan and includes sections on general guidance, project management, and appendices. The general guidance section discusses the scope and complexity of projects and the importance of capturing the decision-making process and communicating progress with regard to the project management plan. | N/A |
| Final Design Report | N/A | The purpose of the final design report is to capture the details of the entire design process. It includes sections on executive summary, prototype test plan,
