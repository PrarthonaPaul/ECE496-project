| Task | Task Percentage | Description | Deadline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Group size | N/A | Students will work in groups of between 4 and 6. Exceptions will only be considered in exceptional situations. | N/A |
| Kinds of projects that are acceptable | N/A | All projects must involve serious software engineering work, including requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. The details will depend on the project, and it could be a prototype, a final version, or an enhancement of an existing system. An iterative, spiral, or star approach is preferred over the waterfall model. | N/A |
| Customers | N/A | Each project must have at least one defined customer, who can be a professor, someone from a company, or the 'open market'. For the latter, market analysis and finding people to review requirements, prototypes, and beta-test the product are required. Customers will read the final report, act as beta testers, and complete questionnaires to determine the final mark. | N/A |
| Type of software | N/A | Any software involving real software development is acceptable, including data processing, MIS, personal productivity, e-commerce, telecom, real-time, embedded systems, and games. However, some types of software may be more challenging to deliver, and feasibility must be justified. Websites are not considered valid projects, but the web can be used as a user interface with programmed functionality. Research-based projects are not acceptable, but software to support researchers is acceptable if it meets other criteria. | N/A |
| Team structure | N/A | The SEG project coordinator acts as the CEO of a small company, with each team as a unit. The co-coordinator can veto decisions and provide advice. One member of each team is elected 'project manager', responsible for project management. Other team members may take specialized roles such as 'chief programmer', 'user interface expert', 'documentation manager/technical writer/configuration manager', 'quality assurance manager', and 'requirements manager'. The final report includes a section describing each person's work. | N/A |
| How will projects be found? | N/A | Projects can be suggested by student groups to the co-ordinator, or the coordinator can approach industry and faculty members for ideas. Projects related to a student's existing employer are accepted under certain conditions: all team members work for the same employer, the SEG project coordinator can direct the work, the project follows the same schedule as other students, and the employer provides written confirmation that students can manage the project according to the rules and that the project can continue despite changes in financial compensation plans. | N/A |
| Financial compensation and intellectual property | N/A | Unless otherwise agreed, SEG project students retain intellectual property rights to their work and can sell it for profit. They must inform customers of this and allow for negotiation. If students receive financial compensation, the customer typically retains intellectual property rights. All intellectual property arrangements must be disclosed to the SEG project supervisor, who must be granted rights to read and run project results. | N/A |
| Schedule for regular (non-coop) students | N/A | SEG4912 (Fall term): Compulsory initial group meeting 3-4 days after classes start, determining the subject matter between April and Sept 15, work on the project from Sept to December with 3 milestones and deliverables (Project definition, Analysis report, Quality Assurance Presentation (Strategy and Framework)) every 4-5 weeks, regular status reports with screenshots ("Mockup", "Hello World", "Demo"), and intermediate evaluation by customers at the end of December. SEG4913 (Winter term): Work on the project from January to April with 3 milestones and deliverables (Design report, Quality Assurance Presentation (Measuring Progress), Final Report) every 4-5 weeks, regular status reports with screenshots ("Alpha Release", "Beta Release", Final Release"), final report due in April of the following year, and final evaluations by customers on the same date. | N/A |
| Schedule for coop students | N/A | SEG4912 (Winter term): Compulsory initial group meeting 3-4 days after classes start, determining the subject matter prior to January 15, work on the project from January to April with 3 milestones and deliverables (Project definition, Analysis report, Quality Assurance Presentation (Strategy and Framework)) every 4-5 weeks, regular status reports with screenshots ("Mockup", "Hello World", "Demo"), and intermediate evaluation by customers at the end of April. SEG4913 (Fall term): Work on the project from September to December with 3 milestones and deliverables (Design report, Quality Assurance Presentation (Measuring Progress), Final Report) every 4-5 weeks, regular status reports with screenshots ("Alpha Release", "Beta Release", Final Release"), final report due in December of the following term, and final evaluations by customers on the same date. | N/A |
| Workload | N/A | Each person is expected to contribute 3-4 person-weeks of work (full-time equivalent) for each of the two semesters of the project, which is the normal workload for a 1-semester 3-credit course. | N/A |
| Grading | N/A | The grading breakdown is as follows: 20% satisfaction of customers (based on questionnaires completed by customers at the end of each course/semester), 20% evaluation of course coordinator based on project management and team professionalism (with individual and group grades combined at the coordinator's discretion), 10% quality of presentations, 20% quality of software design (including maintainability, usability, and reliability), 10% quality of writing and graphics, 10% completeness of written material, and 10% complexity/difficulty/innovation of the project. The grading scheme provides 100% for the project, with the grade for SEG4912 based on the first half of the project grade and the grade for SEG4913 based on the second half. | N/A |
| Proposals | N/A | To officially start the project, a written proposal must be accepted by the SEG project coordinator. The proposal should include group member details (names, student numbers, co-op/non-co-op status, and roles), project title and description (including a clear problem statement), customer names and backgrounds with an interaction plan (with addresses and telephone numbers for off-campus customers and a letter of agreement for open-market projects), interface with non-standard hardware or software, larger project context (if applicable), engineering challenges and risks with mitigation strategies, impact analysis (business, environmental, financial, legal, and end-user perspectives, and relevant standards/legislation), development process (e.g., RUP, SCRUM, spiral model), evaluation procedures (with measurable quality objectives and verification procedures), and a schedule with planned documents and delivery dates (Gantt and Pert charts can be used). Changes to the proposal are allowed during project development, subject to coordinator approval. | N/A
