| Weekly Learning Journals | 30% | One learning journal with three or four questions based on the session will be assigned after each class. As such, your personal takeaways from the sessions and on assigned readings will be essential in discussing what was particularly resonant, how does it connect with content from other courses or experiences and how might you begin to apply this within your personal, inter-personal and professional contexts. | Every Thursday following class |
| Midterm Personal Application Paper | 25% | The mid-term assignment is meant to offer an opportunity for reflection upon material covered and to apply it directly to a particularly important inter-personal context. Your task will be to write about a particularly difficult inter-personal interaction in your life, either professional or personal – one that you felt completely dissatisfied about and did not turn out as planned. The focus of the paper should be on reflecting on the self and answering questions such as: Knowing what I know now… “What kind of tools could I have used to make the situation different / more favourable?” “What was my sense of self and perception of other? How did this play into the dynamic?” Further detail and requirements will be discussed throughout the first half of the course. | Monday, October 28, 2019 |
| Final Organizational Paper | 35% | This assignment will be a group assignment with the intent of demonstrating your ability to integrate key ideas from the course and to apply them within an organizational context. Your group’s task will be to study the chosen organization, reflect upon its organizational culture and begin to articulate how you can make it even more inclusive. The focus will be to connect this inclusive culture to organizational aspirations for impact. Organizations to study and conduct research on will be provided to the class for each group to select upon. Further detail and requirements will be discussed throughout the first half of the course. | Monday, December 2 |
