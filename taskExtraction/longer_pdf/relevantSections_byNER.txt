Marking of Group Work
The Source Analysis assignment part of the Team Podcast Project will be graded on an individual basis as each student will be reviewing 2 academic sources.
 The University of Toronto’s Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters outlines behaviours that constitute academic dishonesty and the process for addressing academic offences. Any student abetting or otherwise assisting in such misconduct will also be subject to academic penalties. You are expected to cite sources in all written work and presentations. Students are allowed to use a Generative AI software to complete the AI Output Evaluation assignment. Academic Integrity Verification
Sometimes, students will be required to submit their assignments to the University’s plagiarism detection tool for a review of textual similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. For the assignments set up to use Ouriginal, the software will review your paper when you upload it to Quercus. why limiting life chances for people with convictions?
