New Topics in Sociology:
Invisible Punishment
SOC489H1S| Winter 2024 | University of Toronto
Room: | Day and Time: Monday 11:10 am – 1pm
COURSE DESCRIPTION
When we think of punishment, we often think of incarceration., Label: IRRELEVANT
Text: However, punishment often does not end when people leave prisons or after sentences are served., Label: IRRELEVANT
Text: Having a criminal record regularly leaves a mark on someone’s life that is difficult to overcome., Label: IRRELEVANT
Text: This course explores the afterlife of incarceration and the ‘collateral’ consequences of coming into contact with the criminal justice system for single individuals, their families, and communities., Label: IRRELEVANT
Text: The course will explore both formal measures established by states and consequences acting through more informal channels such as stigma and financial insecurity., Label: IRRELEVANT
Text: Attention will be paid to how these intersect with and reproduce inequality in society., Label: IRRELEVANT
Text: The course will mostly focus on Canada and the US, but lecture and assigned readings will also offer glimpses of consequences of punishment and a criminal record in a more global context., Label: IRRELEVANT
Text: The latter part of the course will be dedicated to resisting invisible punishment: from existing mechanisms such as pardons and expungements to alternative proposals and approaches to end invisible punishment., Label: IRRELEVANT
Text: The assigned readings and material covered in the seminar will follow recent attempts to decolonialize the curriculum on criminal justice.
