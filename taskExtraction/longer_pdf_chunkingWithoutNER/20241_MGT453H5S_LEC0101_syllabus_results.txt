Please note that some tasks were repeated for each milestone of the group project. The above table only lists each task once, under the due date of the final milestone for that task. 

The given criteria for core tasks include deliverables, assignments, projects, exams, or graded components. These tasks should have specific goals, deadlines, and descriptions, and may include milestones or deliverables. 

Support tasks, on the other hand, are related to general course engagement, preparation, or participation, such as reading materials, using forums, or following communication guidelines. These are ongoing or preparatory activities without direct grading.
