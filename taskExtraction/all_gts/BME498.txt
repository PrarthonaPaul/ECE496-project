BME 498Y: Biomedical Engineering Capstone Design
1. Calendar Information
In this project-based design course teams of students from diverse engineering disciplines (enrolled in the biomedical engineering minor) will engage in the bio-medical technology design process to identify, invent and implement a solution to an unmet clinical need. The students will learn about medical technology development and will engage in the process through lectures, guest lectures delivered by medical technology experts, "hands-on" practicums and a student driven design project. Approval to register in the course must be obtained from the Associate Chair, IBBME - Undergraduate.
2. Course Overview
BME498 is a capstone design project course intended to have students identify unmet clinical needs and/or healthcare-related problems and define a design challenge. In the course of proposing an innovative solution, students are expected to apply their technical background to address the design challenge. Students will be expected to perform additional self-study to understand their challenge but course expectations will be supported by “hands-on” activities presented in lecture and laboratory periods to orientate each team toward proper engineering design. The student-driven design project will take place over both semesters as each team proposes a project and develops a design from initial concept to final working prototype.
The goal of this course is to provide students with the opportunity to practice innovation and engineering design skills within a biomedical context and increase awareness of future entrepreneurial activities. Topics will include needs finding, needs screening, product design specifications, concept generation, concept screening, prototyping, risk assessment, and quality control of medical devices.
NEW FOR FALL 2020:
• The design studio will be open for students visiting campus to build and test their prototypes. Access will be managed through a booking service and/or request form to ensure that social distancing as safety protocols are followed.
• Lectures will be held online (see course schedule dates) using Bb Collaborate and accessible through Quercus in sync with timetable shown below. For students working asynchronously, each lecture will be recorded but students not able to attend virtually during scheduled lectures should notify the instructor to make accommodations.

Project Requirements
Gathering information about your chosen problem and building an accurate understanding of your healthcare-related need will allow you define what a design must do to be an acceptable solution. Furthermore, you must also be able to find ways to differentiate different designs you create and define what a design should be and/or must be in order to be successful. Your team is responsible for submitting a concise document that communicates the design requirements (specifications) of your stated need. Please refer to ‘Guidelines for Project Requirements’ (posted on Quercus) for more information.
Project Proposal
Your team is responsible for drafting a project proposal document that: 1) defines the design problem, 2) proposes possible solutions and selects the most promising design, and 3) provides a plan to carry out the proposed solution. Please refer to ‘Guidelines for Project Proposal’ (posted on Quercus) for more information.
Design Review and Critique
Each team will present an overview of their project and show preliminary prototypes created so far. The aim of this presentation is to demonstrate your knowledge of a healthcare need and the problem you have chosen to solve. The team will defend their design and key decisions with the aim to set your team up for building a working prototype during the winter term. This deliverable is an external design review with the project client, sponsor, or healthcare professional that the team has connected with and the project supervisor.
Demonstration Day Presentation
Each team will present their design and demonstrate their final working prototype to the project supervisors and hopefully some of the users you have connected with as well. Consider this presentation as a pitch to investors or a presentation at a design competition where you still need

Course Outline
to clearly communicate the need you are addressing and the problem you are offering a solution to. The Focus of this presentation should be proving, with test results, that your design solves the problem you have identified. The most successful teams will be able to demonstrate how their design works and this is best achieved by performing a live demonstration. Please refer to ‘Guidelines for Demonstration Day Presentation’ (posted on Quercus) for more information.
Final Project Report
Your team must produce a final report that provides enough information for someone to develop your project further. While much of the project proposal can be reused, you are expected to incorporate feedback from your project supervisors and fellow students to demonstrate you have iterated your original goals, ideas, concepts, designs, etc. Please refer to ‘Guidelines for Final Report’ (posted on Quercus) for more information.
Design Notebook
There is no expectation of completing a design notebook. However, it may be that some individuals want to demonstrate design excellence by thinking deeply about their design problem in ways that are not easy to include in the final report (or project proposal). In this case, individual students may choose to submit their design notebook (see Guidelines for Design Notebooks) that may boost their individual grade when the final report is submitted. Likewise, it may be that some individuals do not contribute to a project satisfactorily as judged by documented team feedback and a track record of progress documentation and progress updates. Should this situation occur, an individual grade may be reduced below the team grade when the final report is submitted.
9. Course Policies
Accommodations for Disabilities
Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. The University provides academic accommodations for students with disabilities in accordance with the terms of the Ontario Human Rights Code. This occurs through a collaborative process that acknowledges a collective obligation to develop an accessible learning environment that both meets the needs of students and preserves the essential academic requirements of the University’s courses and programs. For more information on services and resources available to students, please contact Accessibility Services at (416) 978-8060 or http://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as. Should you have a Letter of Accommodation, you shall notify the instructor within the first 3 weeks of the term to allow appropriate accommodations to be integrated into the course.
Lateness Policy
Graded reports received later than the due date posted will be awarded a 10% deduction compounded for every day that the submission is late. Exceptions may be accommodated for valid reasons (such as severe illness or compassionate grounds), that are out of a student’s

Course Outline
control, and may be considered if supported by written documentation. Examples of invalid reasons would include situations where Quercus submissions were not executed properly by a student, or a student forgot the deadline.
Attendance Policy
While no notification of your absence is necessary, if you are absent, you will be responsible for gathering the information you need from your peers. In the case of the progress presentation that you must deliver, you should coordinate with you team to ensure you will be able to present. If you have a time conflict (e.g., religious obligation, varsity team involvement, academic conferences) with one of the lecture dates where your attendance is counted toward your participation grade you must notify the instructor beforehand to make possible alternative arrangements.
Online Communication Policy
All course-related questions should be posted in the “Course Q & A” discussion. If you have a question you should: 1) check the syllabus or guidelines for your answer, 2) check the Course Q & A discussion to see if your question has already been answered, or 3) ask a peer directly. Every attempt will be made to respond within 3 business days to posts that need the attention of the corresponding TA. If necessary, you may email the instructor regarding personal issues that may impact this course. BME498 must be used at the beginning of the subject line to ensure prompt response to emails. Every attempt will be made to responded to emails within 3 business days.
Academic Integrity Message
Plagiarism is taken very seriously and as per the code of behaviour on academic matters: “it is the students’ responsibility to know what constitutes an academic offense”. As per University of Toronto guidelines: “You need to integrate your acknowledgements into what you're saying. Give the reference as soon as you've mentioned the idea you're using, not just at the end of the paragraph. It's often a good idea to name the authors ("X says" and "Y argues against X,") and then indicate your own stand ("A more inclusive perspective, however, … ")”. Specific instructions on bibliography formats will be given in assignment guideline documents but as a general rule; it is not acceptable to rely on Wikipedia or Google rather than library resources. For more information, please see (www.writing.utoronto.ca/advice/using-sources/how-not-to-plagiarize) for a practical guide and the following links for more information on University of Toronto policies: (http://academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/) (http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Assets/Governing+Council+Digital+Assets/Policies/PDF/ppjun011995.pdf).

10. Additional Course Information
Project budget
Up to $500/team is provided to each team. An itemized budget will be included with the proposal and will need to be approved by the project supervisor before funds greater than $100 are reimbursed. Additional funds (up to $1000 total) may be approved if a strong justification is made to the course coordinator. Teams requesting extra funds will need to write a one-page grant application justifying the need for the additional funds
Grading
Final grades of the project proposal and final report and presentation will be determined with a consensus of the teaching team. Clients will only evaluate your project holistically as a part of the design review and final presentation that will be considered in context by the teaching team. The communication instructor will only provide feedback on written and oral communication and will not grade any materials submitted by students.
Design Studio
NEW FOR FALL 2020:
The design studio will be bookable to ensure that social distancing can be practiced safely.
IBBME safety policy requires that all students take part in safety training prior to using the Design Studio. This has been scheduled for September 13. If students do NOT pass the safety test, they will be given one additional opportunity to rewrite and pass the test. The Design Studio introduction, safety presentation, and quiz should only take 30 minutes. A teaching assistant will be available every week during practicum time to answer questions or help you with your projects. The design studio will only be available during practicum time (i.e., Mondays from 9 – 12) but you may also be able to connect with the design studio facility at the Myhal Centre to work on your project outside of this time.
Teaching Lab
The IBBME Teaching Lab is also reserved for students in BME489 who need access to wet lab facilities. There will be a mandatory training session for students who need access to the Teaching Lab. To use this facility, you must contact the teaching lab coordinator at teachinglab.ibbme@utoronto.ca.
