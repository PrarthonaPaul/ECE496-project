Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on exploring fundamental questions in particle physics through
experiments or simulations. Students will design, conduct, and analyze an experiment or simulation
that addresses a key question in the field. The course includes the development of a project
proposal, experiment design, data analysis, and presentation of findings through a report and at the
Innovation Showcase.
Course Objectives:
Design and conduct a particle physics experiment or simulation.
Analyze data from the experiment or simulation to draw conclusions.
Compare experimental results with theoretical predictions.
Effectively present the project at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in particle physics and experimental design.
Develop practical skills in data analysis and interpretation.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage particle physics projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve designing and conducting an experiment or simulation
that explores a fundamental question in particle physics. The project will be broken down into the
following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal outlining the particle physics question being addressed, the proposed
experiment or simulation, and the anticipated outcomes. Include a timeline and assign roles to team
members.
2. **Experiment Design and Simulation (Weeks 4-6):**
- Design the particle physics experiment or simulation. Develop and test simulations to predict the
outcomes of the experiment.
3. **Experiment Implementation and Data Collection (Weeks 7-10):**
- Conduct the experiment or run simulations, collecting data on particle interactions, decay, or
other phenomena. Analyze the data to identify patterns and validate hypotheses.
4. **Data Analysis and Interpretation (Weeks 11-12):**
- Interpret the data collected, compare the results with theoretical predictions, and refine the
experiment or simulation based on the findings.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire research process, including design decisions, challenges, and outcomes in
a final report.
- Prepare a presentation and poster for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of
the project.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
