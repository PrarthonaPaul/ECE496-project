- Design the sustainable fashion collection and produce samples of key pieces. Test the materials
for durability, comfort, and environmental impact.
4. **Final Collection Production and Sustainability Analysis (Weeks 11-12):**
- Produce the final garments for the collection. Conduct a sustainability analysis, including life
cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon footprint calculation.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire design and production process, including challenges, solutions, and
outcomes in a final report.
