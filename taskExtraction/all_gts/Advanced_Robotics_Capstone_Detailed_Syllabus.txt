Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on the development of advanced robotics systems, with an emphasis
on automation and human-robot interaction. Students will design, build, and test a robotic system
that addresses a specific challenge in the field. The course includes the development of a project
proposal, system design, prototype development, and presentation of findings through a report and
at the Innovation Showcase.
Course Objectives:
Design and implement an advanced robotics system that addresses a real-world challenge.
Conduct system simulations and prototype testing.
Evaluate the system's performance through user testing.
Effectively present the project at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in robotics system design and development.
Develop practical skills in mechanical, electrical, and software engineering.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage complex robotics projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve designing and implementing an advanced robotics
system that addresses a specific challenge in automation or human-robot interaction. The project
will be broken down into the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal detailing the project's objectives, the problem being addressed, and the
anticipated impact. Include a timeline and assign roles to team members.
2. **System Design and Simulation (Weeks 4-6):**
- Design the robotic system, including mechanical, electrical, and software components. Develop a
simulation to test the system's functionality before physical implementation.
3. **Prototype Development (Weeks 7-10):**
- Build and test a prototype of the robotic system. Refine the system based on test results and
ensure it meets the project's objectives.
4. **User Testing and Feedback (Weeks 11-12):**
- Conduct user testing to evaluate the system's performance and gather feedback. Use this
feedback to make necessary adjustments.
5. **Final Report and Showcase Preparation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire development process, including design decisions, challenges, and
outcomes in a final report.
- Prepare a presentation and poster for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of
the project.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
