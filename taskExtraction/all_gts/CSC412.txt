8. Textbooks. There is no required course textbook. The following materials can be helpful.
• Kevin Murphy (2022). Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction
• Kevin Murphy (2023). Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics
• Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman (2009). The Elements of Statistical
Learning
• Christopher M. Bishop (2006). Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning
• David MacKay (2003). Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms
9. Assignments. There will be 3 assignments in this course. The assignments will be released
on the course webpage. Submission instructions will be provided with each assignment.
9.1. Collaboration policy on the assignments. Assignments must be your own individual work.
After attempting the problems on an individual basis, you may discuss and work together on the
homework assignments with up to two classmates. However, you must write your own code
and write up your own solutions individually and explicitly name any collaborators
at the top of the homework.
10. Exams. There will be an in-class midterm exam on the week of Feb 26. Details will
be announced in class and on the course webpage. You can use an optional A4 cheat sheet -
double-sided. Final exam date is TBD. You can use two optional A4 cheat sheets - double-sided.
Collaboration on the exams is not allowed!
11. Late policy. Ten percent of the value will be deducted for each late day (up to 3 days,
then submission is blocked). No credit will be given for assignments submitted after 3 days.

12. Absence declaration. Students who are absent from academic participation for any
reason (e.g., COVID, cold, 
u and other illness or injury, family situation) and who require con-
sideration for missed academic work have been asked to record their absence through the ACORN
online absence declaration. The absence declaration is considered su cient documentation to indi-
cate an absence and no additional information or documentation should be required when seeking
consideration from an instructor. Students should also advise their instructor of their absence.
Instructors will not be automatically alerted when a student declares an absence. It is student's
responsibility to let instructors know that they have used the Absence Declaration
so that you can discuss any needed consideration, where appropriate.
13. Grading concerns. Any requests to have graded work re-evaluated must be made within
one week of the date the grade is released. Re-evaluation may result in a decrease in the grade.
14. Computing. In the assignments and project, you may need to write your own programs,
debug them, and use them to conduct various experiments, plot curves, etc. You may use any
programming language, but Python is preferable. For some of the assignments, we will provide
you a starter code in Python only.
15. Missed Tests.
• If a test is missed for a valid reason, you must submit documentation to the course instructor.
• If a test is missed for a valid medical reason, you must submit the absence declaration form
and let your instructor know immediately.
• The form will only be accepted as valid if the form is  lled out according to the instructions
on the form.
• If the midterm test is missed for a valid reason then the  nal test will be worth 70% of your
 nal grade. Other reasons for missing a test will require prior approval by your instructor.
If prior approval is not received for non-medical reasons then you will receive a term test
grade of zero.
16. Accommodation for Disability Policy. Please send your documented accessibility
requests directly to the instructor, at least a week before the due date of each evaluation item.
Extensions may be granted, and the duration will be determined based on the letter from the
Accessibility Services at the University of Toronto.
