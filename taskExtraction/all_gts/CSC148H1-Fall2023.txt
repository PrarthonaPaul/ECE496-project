Course Syllabus
Edit
Welcome to CSC148! This course, Introduction to Computer Science, introduces you to how
computer scientists think in a systematic way about computing. Our goal is to provide you with skills
for approaching program design in a principled way, using techniques such as encapsulation,
modularity, information-hiding, comparing different implementations for efficiency, and building
powerful data structures.
The material posted on Quercus is required reading. It contains important information: assignment
handouts, the policy on missed work, links to the online discussion forum, the announcements page,
and more. You are responsible for all announcements made in lecture and on Quercus.
Please direct all personal questions to csc148-2023-09@cs.toronto.edu
(mailto:csc148-2023-09@cs.toronto.edu) .
Course team
Professor David Liu is the instructor for both sections of this course. David and Instructional Support
staff deal with all administrative issues such as missed work, the course website, and TA issues.
Sophia Huynh is Lab Coordinator, which means she deals with all issues related to the weekly preps
and labs.
To learn more about our course staff and teaching assistants, check out our Course Team
(https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/309680/pages/course-team) page.
Lectures
The first lecture is Monday, September 11. All lectures start at 10 minutes past the hour and end
on the hour. This allows for 10 minutes of travel/break time if you have back-to-back classes.

Active learning
During lectures, we will present material and demonstrate problem-solving for part of the time. There
will also regularly be exercises that you complete. Be prepared to get your gears turning in class!
There is very strong evidence, and our experience also shows, that active learning works better than
passively listening to a lecture. We also think it's a lot more fun!
Lecture recordings
We are participating in the University of Toronto's Opencast Content Capture Pilot, which will
automatically record lectures and post them on the OCCS Student App (https://q.utoronto.ca/courses
/309680/external_tools/11190) . However, because of the amount of active learning that will take place
during lecture, please note that simply watching these videos is not a substitute for attending class!
Our recommendation is to use these recordings for review purposes only, or if you miss a lecture due
to extenuating circumstances. If you did miss the lecture, we strongly recommend working through
the in-class exercises (which are posted separately on Quercus) when we reach those points in the
lecture, so that your experience is as close to the live classroom experience as possible. These
recordings are meant for your personal learning, and you may not distribute these recordings or make
your own (please see the Copyright notice (https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/292907/assignments
/syllabus?wrap=1#copyright-notice) below).
Labs
After lectures each week, you will participate in an in-person two-hour lab, where you will reinforce
and extend your learning from lecture that week. The first lab is Thursday, September 14. Like
lectures, all tutorials start at 10 minutes past the hour. You must register for a lab section
(TUT____) on ACORN, separate from your lecture section. You are allowed to pick any lab time
independent of your lecture time.
We have designed the labs to not simply be a repeat of work you did in lecture, but to give you
different kinds of opportunities to problem-solve and practice what you've learned. For more
information about the labs, check out Policies and Guidelines: Weekly Labs (https://q.utoronto.ca
/courses/309680/pages/policies-and-guidelines-weekly-labs?wrap=1) .

Office hours
David will hold regular office hours throughout the semester, and we will schedule additional TA office
hours in the weeks before assignment deadlines. You are welcome to attend any of the scheduled
office hours, and do not need to book an appointment.
David's office hours are student-driven, meaning he won't have any material prepared. Instead, the
discussion will be based on whatever questions you'd like to ask. Office hours are also group-based,
meaning we'll generally prioritize questions that aren't specific to any particular student, but rather to
course concepts and answers that every student can benefit from. However, there will be opportunity
to ask individual questions during David's office hours. All TA office hours (for assignment help) will be
one-on-one, but please note that individual help will be limited when office hours get busy before an
assignment is due. This is a major reason why you should start your assignments early!
If you have a personal matter to discuss, please read about how to book an individual appointment
with David in the Contact section (https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/292907/assignments/syllabus#contactwebsite-

CSC148 Community Code of Conduct
[This section is based in part on the Contributor Covenant (https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) .]
All members of the course staff and all students are part of the same CSC148 community, and we
share the common goal of creating a safe and positive learning environment for every student. Each
of us is responsible for creating this environment, and must follow the guidelines below when
participating in this course.
1. Use welcoming and inclusive language. Show empathy towards other community members.
Call people by their preferred names and pronouns. Do not make offensive comments about an
individual or group (e.g., gender, sexual orientation, disability and mental illness, or race). Avoid
humour or sarcastic remarks based on such comments or stereotypes.
2. Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences. Gracefully give and accept constructive
criticism.
Look for (and reflect on) ideas and perspectives that are different than your own. Make a genuine
effort to thank those who share them. It is natural to disagree with something a member of our
community has written, and you are permitted to voice your disagreement. However, when doing
so take the following into consideration: try to understand where the other person might be coming
from; do not assume the other person's motives or draw inferences from their identity; be polite in
your response and state where you agree.
3. Be professional in your conversations.
While conversations about topics unrelated to CSC148 or even the University of Toronto are
certainly permitted (and encouraged), keep these conversations professional as you would in the
workplace. Do not share sexual or violent content and avoid profanity.
4. Respect the personal boundaries of each community member.
While we encourage you to make use of this course's online platforms to meet each other to form
academic and social connections, no one is obligated to do so. Everyone will have different
boundaries and comfort levels that may change over time and depending on the situation. When
in doubt, ask. If someone has asked you to respect one of their boundaries (e.g., not to contact
them), with or without a reason, please respect their wishes. Do not reveal any person's personal
information or private communications to a third person (or publicly) without receiving their explicit
consent.
If you experience a violation of this code of conduct in a CSC148 space, or witness such a violation
(even if it is not directed at you), or have any other concerns, please contact the course staff at
csc148-2023-09@cs.toronto.edu (mailto:csc148-2023-09@cs.toronto.edu) . We will respond to you in
a timely manner and everything you say will be confidential.
Contact: website, email, discussion board
All course announcements will be made on Quercus, and you are responsible for reading all
announcements made in this course.
We'll be using Piazza (https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/309680/external_tools/18207?wrap=1) as our online
discussion forum. Please post all of your questions about the course material and assignments on
Piazza so that everyone can benefit from your questions. We will monitor the discussion board
regularly, but it may take longer near assignment due dates, so try to start assignments early in case
you have questions. Also, please answer questions from other students—helping someone else learn
is one of the most effective ways of truly mastering a subject.
For personal matters such as missing course work due to illness, please use the course email
account, csc148-2023-09@cs.toronto.edu (mailto:csc148-2023-09@cs.toronto.edu) , and do not
email your instructor directly. Send your email from your U of T address (@mail.utoronto.ca), and
include your full name, UTORid, and student number in the body of the email. You may request an
appointment with your instructor to seek advice on personal matters, but please note that questions
about course content should be asked either through the online discussion board or during office
hours.
Please do not use Quercus messaging, as course staff will not be monitoring their Quercus inboxes.
Prerequisites
CSC108 or equivalent programming experience is assumed. We'll be using Python in the course, but
comfort with other imperative programming languages like Java or C should be fine. There will be a
ramp-up session during the first weekend of term for students whose background is not in Python or
who feel they need a refresher. Find out more on our Ramp-Up Session (https://q.utoronto.ca
/courses/309680/pages/ramp-up-session?wrap=1) page.
Here are some links to CSC108 materials and general advice:

Weekly Preparation Exercises (8%)
Weekly preparation exercises (https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/309680/pages/policies-and-guidelinesweekly-
preparation-exercises) ("preps") consist of a few readings and short exercises that you
complete before each week of lecture. We have designed these preps to help you stay on track and
learn simpler concepts independently so that we can focus on more complex content and skills in
lecture and tutorial.
Each prep consists of a short reading from the CSC148 Lecture Notes
(https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc148h/notes/) , a series of short-answer comprehension
questions hosted in an online Quercus quiz, and then some programming exercises that you will
download and submit to using the online MarkUs application.
Notes:
There is an ungraded prep due Wednesday September 13 before 9am.
The first graded prep exercise will be due Monday September 18 before 10am.
There is no prep due the week of the midterm (on Wednesday October 18).
The final prep exercise will be due at the start of "Week 11" on Monday November 27 before
10am. There will be no prep on Week 12, to give you a bit of a break at the end of the semester!
We will drop the lowest prep grade (including a 0 due to not submitting the prep).
Weekly labs (8%)
Each weekly lab has a participation grade. We expect every student who attends the lab and puts in
an honest effort for the whole lab session will receive this grade each week. For more information,
check out Policies and Guidelines: Weekly Labs (https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/309680/pages
/policies-and-guidelines-weekly-labs?wrap=1) . We also allow each student to miss one lab, as we will
only count the best 8 of 9 attendance grades towards your final course grade.
Assignments (25%)
Assignments (https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/309680/pages/policies-and-guidelines-assignments) are
larger pieces of programming work that span multiple course topics, and require you to apply and
synthesize your knowledge and skills from multiple areas in computer science. Assignments will be
posted online, and will be submitted to the MarkUs application. Assignment 0 must be completed
individually, but Assignments 1 and 2 may be completed with one other student currently enrolled in
CSC148H1 (on the St. George campus).
Working with a partner
You may choose your own partner, from any section of this course, and it need not be the same
person for each assignment. Once you begin working on an assignment, you may not dissolve your
partnership without our permission. Both partners will receive the same mark for joint assignments. If
you choose to work with a partner for an assignment, you must form a group on MarkUs
(https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Wiki/blob/v2.3.0/Student_Groups.md) . You should declare a
partnership well before the deadline (there is no downside of doing so).
Working with a partner has the potential to lighten your workload and to increase your learning, or to
make things worse. It all depends on how well you work together. Remember that you are responsible
for learning the course material underlying all parts of the assignments. You will have the most
success if you truly work together.
If you and your partner are not working well together, please contact us through the course account
without delay. We can do little to help if you contact us close to the assignment due date. Students
are sometimes reluctant to ask for help, feeling that it is a kind of betrayal. However, experience has
shown us that things rarely go well when students avoid the problem. We are here to help. You can
dissolve a group up to five days before the due date. In order to do so, at least one student in the
group must email the course email address before this time. Course staff will then follow up with all
group members. After this deadline, no dissolution of groups will be permitted.
Midterm (16%) and Final Exam (41%)
The Midterm and Final Exam (https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/309680/pages/policies-and-guidelinesmidterm-
test-and-final-exam) are used to evaluate your learning in a focused setting in the middle of
the semester (Midterm) and at the end of the course (Final Exam). The Midterm will take place during
lecture time on the scheduled date, replacing the regular lecture.
IMPORTANT NOTE: You must receive a grade of at least 40% on the final exam to pass CSC148.
Students who do not meet this threshold (including students who do not write the final exam) will have
their course grade lowered to below 50.
Special Consideration
Students experiencing illness or other emergencies that prevent them from being able to complete
homework on time, or write a test, can request special consideration. You will be required to affirm
that you are abiding by the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters
(http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Assets/Governing+Council+Digital+Assets/Policies
/PDF/ppjun011995.pdf) , in particular, to be aware that it is an academic offence
to engage in any form of cheating, academic dishonesty or misconduct, fraud or misrepresentation
not herein otherwise described, in order to obtain academic credit or other academic advantage of
any kind
That is, you must be truly experiencing an emergency, and acknowledge that to falsely claim so is an
academic offence. Making a request does not guarantee that you will be granted special
consideration.
Special Consideration Request Form (https://forms.office.com/r/kyQPtWGXvN)
(read the policy details below carefully before submitting a request!)
Weekly Preps
Weekly preparation exercises generally include two graded components: a Quercus quiz and
programming exercises submitted on MarkUs. Late submissions are NOT accepted on either part
of the weekly prep.
Assignments: Late submission accommodation policy
For assignments, which are significantly larger in scope, we recognize that unexpected problems,
illness, and disability-related barriers sometimes make it difficult to submit assignments on time. For
this reason, we are adopting a policy of radical generosity with respect to assignment submissions.
You may request an extension of up to four days for any assignment submission by completing the
special consideration form (https://forms.office.com/r/kyQPtWGXvN) . Notes:
After making this request, you should see the extension appear on MarkUs within two business
days (so please do not contact us if you don't see it right away).
In A1 and A2, if you are working with a partner:
You must create your group on MarkUs and make sure your partner has been invited before
requesting the extension.
Only one partner needs to request the extension.
You may not dissolve your partnership after requesting an extension without contacting the
course email address first.
You may request this extension up to 4 days after the assignment due date. However, note that
the extended time will be relative to the assignment deadline, not relative to when you request the
extension.
If you initially request a shorter (e.g., 2-day extension), you can fill out the form again to request a
longer extension. We will always use the most recent extension request you have asked for (up to
4 days after the assignment due date).
No assignment submitted beyond this extension (even 1 second late!) will be graded.
If you have been granted an extension of four days and then become ill on the extended due date,
no further extension will be given unless further documentation is provided.
While it may seem like a "no-brainer" to always request a four-day extension for each assignment, we
strongly recommend not making this request lightly. We have designed your assignments so that they
can be completed by their actual deadlines, and we believe that for the vast majority of students,
meeting these deadlines is the best way to keep up with the course material. Please do not use this
policy lightly to simply shift the original deadline.
Students registered with Accessibility Services are free to use this policy. However, if you would like
to request additional accommodations (beyond a 4-day extension), please reach out to the course
email address before the original assignment deadline.
If you find yourself in a serious medical or emergency situation where a 4-day extension will not
be sufficient, please email csc148-2023-09@cs.toronto.edu (mailto:csc148-2023-09@cs.toronto.edu)
before the original assignment due date. We may require further documentation or confirmation
from your college registrar, and further extensions are not always granted. So, you should submit any
partial work that you've completed before the original assignment due date. Please also complete an
Absence Declaration on ACORN when appropriate, (https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current
/academics/student-absences) and send the notification to the course email address.
Finally, note that this policy only applies to assignments, and not the Weekly Preparation Exercises,
which must be submitted on time to be graded.
Missed Midterm
You may request special consideration if you missed the midterm due to illness or other extenuating
circumstances by submitting the special consideration form (https://forms.office.com
/r/kyQPtWGXvN) . You will be asked to provide additional information, and this will be reviewed by the
course staff. You should also complete an Absence Declaration on ACORN when appropriate
(https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/academics/student-absences) , and send the notification to the
course email address. Special consideration is NOT always granted. If it is granted, the weight of your
midterm will be transferred to the final exam.
Accommodations and accessibility services
Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. In particular, if you have
a disability or health consideration that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach
your instructor and/or the Accessibility Services Office as soon as possible. The Accessibility
Services staff are available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals, and arrange
appropriate accommodations. The sooner you let them and us know your needs, the quicker we can
assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course. For more information on services and
resources available to students, including registering for accommodations, please see the U of T
Accessibility Services website (https://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as) .
Midterm remark requests
If you believe there was an error in the marking of the midterm test, you may request that it be
remarked. Please complete and submit a Remark Request Form via email to
csc148-2023-09@cs.toronto.edu (mailto:csc148-2023-09@cs.toronto.edu) . You must give a specific
reason for the request, referring to a possible error or omission by the marker. Please note that when
we receive a remark request, we regrade the entire submission, not just a specific question. Your
mark may go up or down as a result of the remark.
For prompt turnaround, remark requests must be received within one week of when the midterm was
returned.
Academic integrity
The work you submit must be your own. It is an academic offence to copy the work of someone else.
This includes their files, their words, and even their ideas. Whether you copy or let someone else
copy your work, it is an offence. We want you to benefit from working with other students and will give
you plenty of opportunities to do so in lectures and labs. But when it comes to course assessments,
collaboration on solutions is strictly forbidden (except between partners on Assignments 1 and
2). The most certain way to protect yourself is not to discuss solutions with students other than your
partner. Certainly, you must not let others see your solutions, even in draft form. Do not post your
solutions on public online platforms like GitHub, as these can be searched and used by other
students. (See the "Your course work" section below for our advice about using private GitHub
repositories.)
For more information about what is and isn't allowed, please see Academic Integrity in CSC148
(https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/309680/pages/academic-integrity-in-csc148?wrap=1) .
Policy on generative AI (including ChatGPT)
In this course, you may use generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including ChatGPT and GitHub
Copilot, as learning aids and to help complete weekly preps and assignments. You will not be
permitted to use generative AI on the midterm test or final exam. While some generative AI tools are
currently available for free in Canada, please be warned that these tools have not been vetted by the
University of Toronto and might not meet University guidelines or requirements for privacy, intellectual
property, security, accessibility, and records retention. Generative AI may produce content which is
incorrect or misleading, or inconsistent with the expectations of this course. These tools may be
subject to service interruptions, software modifications, and pricing changes during the semester.
Generative AI is not required to complete any aspect of this course, and we caution you to not
rely on these tools to complete your coursework. Instead, we recommend treating generative AI as a
supplementary tool only for exploration or drafting content. Ultimately, you (and not any AI tool) are
responsible for your own learning in this course, and for all the work you submit for credit. It is your
responsibility to critically evaluate the content generated, and to regularly assess your own learning
independent of generative AI tools. Overreliance on generative AI may give you a false sense of how
much you’ve actually learned, which can lead to poor performance on the midterm test or final exam,
in later courses, or in future work or studies after graduation.

Lecture and tutorial recordings
You may not make your own recordings of video, audio, or text chat, of lectures or tutorials, whether
in person or online. Course staff may upload lecture recordings on the course website for your use
(but you may not distribute these).
Your course work
Work that you complete for CSC148 (including exercises, assignments, and tests) may not be shared
with other students or published. This policy is to both protect the intellectual property of course staff
(including, for example, the design and starter files for assignments), and to protect you from
committing acts of academic dishonesty. For more information on this topic, see the Department of
Computer Science website (https://web.cs.toronto.edu/undergraduate/portfolio-advice) .
GitHub (https://www.github.com) is a popular option for computer science students and professionals
to both collaborate in teams and publish their work online, including to develop a portfolio for potential
employers. As we said in the Academic Integrity section, you should not put your work publicly on
GitHub. However, you may use GitHub's private repositories to store your own work, and work with
a group on course assignments. (See GitHub's instructions for creating a repository
(https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo) and select "Private" in
Step 4.)
