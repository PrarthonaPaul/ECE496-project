Offi ce Hours:
Tuesdays and Thursdays, 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM
Course Description
In this second-year course, students develop software projects that require the implementation of advanced datastructures and algorithms. Projects may include developing a search engine, a sorting algorithm, or a datavisualization tool. The course emphasizes hands-on experience with data structures, algorithm design, andsoftware development.
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1.
Implement and analyze various data structures.
2.
Design and evaluate algorithms for effi ciency and effectiveness.
3.
Develop software applications that utilize advanced data structures and algorithms.
4.
Test and debug software projects.
5.
Document and present their design and implementation process.
