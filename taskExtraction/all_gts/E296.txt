Course
Description
This
is
a
project-­‐based
course
required
of
all
students
in
the
Master
of
Engineering
program.
In
this
course,
students
work
in
teams
of
3
to
5
to
solve
a
real-­‐world
problem
through
integration
of
the
depth
of
knowledge
from
their
technical
coursework,
with
the
breadth
of
knowledge
from
the
M.Eng.
leadership
courses
(ENGIN
271
and
ENGIN
272).
The
capstone
projects
require
teams
to
develop
a
solution
that
meets
an
industry,
market
or
social
need
through
the
use
of
a
new
technology
or
a
new
application
of
an
existing
technology.
There
are
3
basic
capstone
project
models,
differentiated
by
the
advising,
as
well
as
the
source
of
resources
used
on
the
project.
• University
Project.
(Open
Project):
Students
work
directly
with
a
UC
Berkeley
faculty
member,
typically
on
a
project
related
to
technology
developed
in
the
faculty
member’s
lab.
These
projects
may
also
involve
collaboration
within
UC
Berkeley
or
the
UC
system
(e.g.,
UCSF).
The
faculty
advisor
is
the
primary
project
advisor.
• Industry-­‐University
Collaboration
(Open
Project):
These
projects
are
typically
proposed
and
led
by
UC
Berkeley
faculty
in
collaboration
with
an
existing
industry
partner.
The
faculty
advisor
is
the
primary
project
advisor,
and
the
industry
advisor
is
the
secondary
advisor.
• Industry-­‐Led
Projects
or
“Virtual
Internships:
(Closed
Project):
The
Industry
advisor
sets
the
scope
of
work
and
direction,
and
the
company
supplies
all
resources
needed
for
the
project.
The
industry
advisor
would
be
the
primary
project
lead,
and
paired
with
a
faculty
advisor
who
would
sign
off
on
the
project
and
assign
the
grade
at
its
completion.
Note
that
these
types
of
projects
may
require
students
to
sign
Non-­‐Disclosure
Agreements
with
the
participating
company.
Course
Format/Instructors
There
is
no
formal
classroom
instruction.
The
main
activity
is
open-­‐ended
project
work
under
direct
supervision
of
the
team’s
faculty
and/or
industry
advisors.
Separate
sections
of
the
course
are
created
for
each
faculty
advisor,
and
students
enroll
in
their
advisor’s
sections.
Overall
coordination
of
the
course
is
the
responsibility
of
Dr.
Don
Wroblewski
through
his
role
as
Director
Capstone
Projects
in
the
Fung
Institute
for
Engineering
Leadership.

Deliverables
Reporting
Deliverables:
There
are
3
required
reporting
deliverables
for
the
course,.
• Capstone
Expo
Exhibit:
Each
team
creates
a
display/exhibit
that
describes
their
project
and
demonstrates
their
progress
to
date.
Teams
are
expected
to
create
a
dynamic
and
creative
display
that
will
attract
people’s
attention
and
effectively
communicate
their
work.
• Capstone
Showcase
Presentation:
Each
team
presents
the
results
of
their
capstone
project
in
a
10-­‐minute
presentation
followed
by
a
10
minute
Q&A
session.
Teams
are
also
required
to
create
1-­‐minute
video
pitch
that
highlights
their
work.
• Final
Project
Report:
Each
student
submits
an
individual
final
report
to
the
faculty
advisor
or
faculty
liaison.
This
report
is
a
program-­‐level
requirement
for
the
Masters
of
Engineering
degree,
requiring
signatures
from
the
faculty
advisor/liaison
and
from
a
2nd
Reader
indicating
a
passing
grade.
The
2nd
reader
must
be
a
faculty
member
from
the
student’s
department.
See
details
of
the
final
report
below.
Project
Deliverables:
In
addition
to
the
reporting
deliverables,
teams
are
expected
to
submit
3
interim
project
deliverables
and
a
final
project
deliverable
to
their
project
advisors.
The
interim
deliverables
are
due
in
the
middle
and
end
of
the
Fall
semester
and
in
the
middle
of
the
spring
semester,
and
the
final
project
deliverable
is
due
by
the
end
of
spring
semester.
The
nature
of
these
deliverable
will
depend
upon
the
type
of
project.
Specification
of
the
deliverables
and
their
specific
due
dates
will
be
a
required
assignment
in
the
Project
Management
module
of
ENGIN
271,
and
will
be
determined
by
consultation
between
team
members
and
their
advisors.
The
final
project
deliverable
could
take
on
several
forms:
a
prototype
of
a
potential
product,
either
physical,
digital,
or
some
combination;
a
tool,
such
as
an
app
or
a
subsystem
that
could
be
integrated
with
existing
products;
a
proof
of
concept,
that
shows
that
a
specific
idea
or
solution
is
feasible;
or
a
technical
assessment
of
a
new
technology
in
terms
of
the
industry,
societal,
or
market
need
that
it
addresses.
Student
Learning
Outcomes
The
learning
outcomes
of
the
capstone
project
include
students
gaining
experience
with
the
following:
• Integration
of
broad-­‐based
business/leadership
skills
with
in-­‐depth
technical
skills.
• Identification
of
stakeholders
(those
affected
by
solution)
and
the
competing
interests
of
different
stakeholders
• Formulation
of
industry/market
or
societal
need
that
can
be
addressed
by
new
technology
or
new
use
of
existing
technology
MASTER

• Generation
of
an
engineered
solution
to
address
the
need
in
the
form
of
a
work
product
that
creates
value
for
stakeholders
• Coordination
of
the
project
through
planning
and
team
management
• Communication
of
project
outcomes
to

providing
evidence
of
value
of

Grading
Faculty
advisors
or
faculty
liaisons
are
responsible
for
assigning
grades,
with
separate
grades
for
each
individual
on
the
project
team.
For
fall
semester,
advisors
must
assign
an
IP
grade
(In
Progress).
For
spring
semester,
they
assign
a
single
final
project
grade
that
will
count
towards
the
entire
5
units.
There
are
no
formal
rubrics
for
assigning
the
letter
grade,
but
advisors
are
expected
to
assign
a
grade
that
reflects
the
overall
quality
and
quantity
of
work
that
the
student
performs
throughout
the
2
semesters.
To
some
extent,
that
can
be
partially
gleaned
from
the
Final
Project
Report,
but
the
assessment
should
also
consider
the
following
metrics:
• Quality
and
timeliness
of
the
3
interim
and
final
deliverables.
• Extent
of
contribution
of
the
student
to
the
overall
project
outcome.
• Consistency
of
effort
throughout
the
two
semesters.
Coordination
with
M.Eng.
Leadership
Curriculum
In
ENGIN
296,
teams
focus
mainly
on
the
technical
aspects
of
the
problem
solution,
working
directly
with
their
faculty
and/or
industry
advisor.
Leadership
and
business
aspects
of
the
projects
are
accomplished
mainly
by
integration
with
leadership
curriculum
in
several
ways:
• Addressing
specific
aspects
of
the
project
through
written
assignments
in
the
various
modules
of
ENGIN
271
and
ENGIN
272-­‐-­‐
accounting,
finance,
marketing,
intellectual
property,
organizational
behavior
and
technology/industry
strategy.
• Coordination
of
the
projects
through
assignments
in
the
project
management
module
of
ENGIN
271
and
ENGIN
272,
including
development
of
team
contracts,
project
deliverable
specifications,
project
plans,
and
regular
status
updates
of
projects.
• Creation
and
refinement
of
reporting
deliverables
through
assignments
in
ENGIN
295,
Capstone
Integration.
Final
Report
The
final
reports
for
the
capstone
projects
are
individual
deliverables,
as
opposed
to
team
deliverables.
However,
sections
of
the
report
will
be
common
among
team
members.
These
common
sections
will
of
summaries
of
written
assignments
from
ENGIN
271
and
ENGIN
272
that
deal
with
the
business
aspects
of
the
project.
They
will
serve
as
introductory
chapters
that
set
up
the
main
body
of
the
report.
The
main
body
will
be
individually
written,
covering
the
technical
work
and
outcome
of
the
project,
specifically
focused
on
that
team
member’s

contribution

effort.
This
overall
structure
of
the
report
and
the
format
for
the
technical

section
will
be
described
in
detail
in
E295.
Company-­‐Proprietary
Material
Students
working
on
industry
projects
should
meet
with
their
industry
advisor
at
the
beginning
of
the
project
to
discuss
whether
they
will
be
working
with
company-­‐proprietary
material.
Some
companies
may
ask
students
to
sign
Non
Disclosure
Agreements
(NDA)
to
protect
their
confidential
information.
If
a
company
requires
an
NDA,
then
please
inform
your
faculty
advisor
and
the
Director
Capstone
Experience
(dewroblewski@berkeley.edu)
before
executing
these
agreements.
Regardless
whether
an
NDA
is
signed,
all
students
are
expected
to
behave
in
a
manner
that
protects
any
company
confidential
material.
This
may
include
excluding
specific
details
from
reports
and
presentations.
When
in
doubt,
always
discuss
with
your
industry
advisor.
Plagiarism:
To
copy
text,
photos,
drawings
or
any
other
ideas
from
another
source
without
appropriate
reference
is
plagiarism
and
will
result
in
a
grade
penalty
for
the
project
up
to
and
including
a
failing
grade.
The
latter
would
prevent
you
from
graduating.
In
addition,
there
may
be
further
disciplinary
action
as
well.

additional
information
on
plagiarism
and
how
to
avoid
it,
