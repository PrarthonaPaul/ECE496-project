Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on the development and testing of innovative textile materials.
Students will research, develop, and test a new or improved textile material, culminating in a
presentation at the Innovation Showcase. The course includes the development of a project
proposal, material research, fabrication, and a final report.
Course Objectives:
Develop and test innovative textile materials with enhanced properties.
Conduct research on existing textile technologies and materials.
Fabricate and test textile samples in a laboratory setting.
Effectively present the textile material at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in textile science and material development.
Develop practical skills in research and material testing.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage textile science projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve the development and testing of innovative textile
materials. The project will be broken down into the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal detailing the textile material, intended application, and research objectives.
Include a timeline and assign roles to team members.
2. **Material Research and Development (Weeks 4-6):**
- Conduct research on existing textile materials and technologies. Develop a new or improved
textile material with enhanced properties, such as durability, breathability, or sustainability.
3. **Fabrication and Testing (Weeks 7-10):**
- Fabricate samples of the textile material in a laboratory setting. Conduct tests to evaluate the
material's performance, including strength, wear resistance, and environmental impact.
4. **Optimization and Analysis (Weeks 11-12):**
- Optimize the textile material based on testing results. Analyze the data and compare the
material's performance with industry standards.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire research and development process, including challenges, solutions, and
outcomes in a final report.
- Prepare a presentation for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of the textile
material.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
