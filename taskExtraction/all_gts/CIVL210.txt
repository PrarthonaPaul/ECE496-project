Course Description
In this second-year course, students design and analyze a small-scale structural project, such as a pedestrian bridgeor a building framework. The project is based on specifi cations provided by a fi ctitious client.
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1.
Apply structural analysis and design principles to real-world projects.
2.
Select appropriate materials and conduct material testing.
3.
Perform load calculations and ensure safety factors are met.
4.
Create technical drawings and documentation.
5.
Work effectively in teams to complete engineering projects.
6.
Communicate design concepts and results through written reports and oral presentations.
