Course Description
This course is designed to follow PSY230 (Introduction to Personality) and/or PSY240 (Introduction to Abnormal Psychology). It assumes a working familiarity with the major theories of personality and/or psychological disorders. We will cover the most influential theories of psychotherapy of past and present, and how they are integrated and applied in modern practice. This will be accomplished through lectures, the critical analysis of films demonstrating each therapeutic approach, and the assigned text. The lectures and films will follow and build upon the assigned readings, so please try to read them in advance. As noted below, it will also be in your best interest to finish readings on time in order to be fully prepared for in-class quizzes.

IMPORTANT COURSE POLICIES ***PLEASE READ***
Missed Test Special Consideration Request Process Students who miss a test due to circumstances beyond their control (e.g., illness or an accident) can request that the Department grants them special consideration. Students must present their case to the Department (not the Instructor) by submitting a request via the online Special Consideration Request form at: https://utmapp.utm.utoronto.ca/SpecialRequest.
Students are to submit original supporting documentation (e.g., medical certificates, verification of extenuating circumstances form, etc.) to the Psychology Academic Counselor or drop it in the drop box located outside the Psychology Office, Deerfield Hall, 4th Floor. Students have up to one week from the date of the missed test to submit a request. Late submissions will not be considered without a letter of explanation specifying and documenting the reasons for lateness.
Medical certificates or physician’s notes must be completed by the physician and must include the statement "[Student name] was unable to write the test on [date] for medical reasons". This documentation must show that the physician was consulted within one day of the missed test. A statement merely acknowledging a report of illness made by the student to the physician is not acceptable. For further information on this procedure, please see: http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/psychology/undergraduate-studies/missed-testslate-submissions.
If you missed a deadline for a reason connected to your registered disability, please be advised that the Department accepts documentation supplied by the UTM AccessAbility Resource Centre.
Important: The Department of Psychology verifies the authenticity of medical certificates by contacting medical offices. Students are not to make any changes to completed medical certificates. Students who submit forged or altered documentation are subject to severe academic penalties.
For tests: If the department approves your request, a make-up test will be offered. You will receive an e-mail when a make-up date has been arranged. The department will try to give 2-3 days notice of the make-up date, however this is sometimes not possible. Be prepared for the make-up.
For in-class quizzes: If the Department approves your request, the value of other completed quizzes will be redistributed accordingly.
Extension of Time Special Consideration Request Process Students who seek to be granted more time to complete their term work beyond the due date without penalty, owing to circumstances beyond their control (e.g., illness or an accident), must do so by submitting a request directly to the Instructor for the period up to and including the last day of the term. The decision as to whether or not to apply a penalty for the specified period rests with the Instructor.
Summer 2019 - Department of Psychology Page 3
Students who seek to be granted more time to complete term work beyond the last day of the term must submit their request directly to the Department. This request covers the period following the last day of classes and ends the last day of the exam period. This is done by submitting a request via the online Special Consideration Request form at: https://utmapp.utm.utoronto.ca/SpecialRequest. It is recommended you seek advising by the Departmental Undergraduate Counselor prior to the deadline.
Original supporting documentation (e.g., medical certificates, accident reports, etc.) must be submitted to the Academic Counselor or dropped off in the drop box located outside the Psychology Office, Deerfield Hall, 4th Floor. Students are expected to submit requests to the Department before the last day of the term, unless demonstrably serious reasons prevent them from doing so. In the event of an illness, medical certificates or doctor’s notes must confirm that the student was ill on the due date of the assignment (for a one-day extension). For a longer extension, documentation must specify the full duration during which academic work could not be carried out.
For extensions of time beyond the examination period, you must submit a petition through the Office of the Registrar: http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/registrar/current-students/petitions.
Penalties for Lateness A penalty of 10% per calendar day (i.e., including weekends and holidays during which students are not able to submit term work) up to and including the last day of classes will be applied by the Instructor. After the last day of classes, the penalty of 10% per calendar day will be applied by the Undergraduate Counselor on behalf of the Department. No penalty will be assigned if request for special consideration, described above, is successful.
Academic Guidelines It is your responsibility to ensure that you have met all prerequisites listed in the UTM Calendar for this course. If you lack any prerequisites you will be removed from the course up until the last day to add a course. Further information about academic regulations, course withdrawal dates, and credits can be found in the University of Toronto Mississauga Calendar at: http://www.erin.utoronto.ca/regcal/.

AccessAbility Services Students requiring academic accommodations for learning, physical, sensory, or mental health disabilities or medical conditions should contact the AccessAbility Office (2037B Davis Building) at: (905) 828-3847. Also see: http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/accessability/.

Academic Honesty and Plagiarism Honesty and fairness are considered fundamental to the University's mission, and, as a result, all those who violate those principles are dealt with as if they were damaging the integrity of the University itself. When students are suspected of cheating or a similar academic offence, they are typically surprised at how formally and seriously the matter is dealt with—and how severe the consequences can be if it is determined that cheating did occur. The University of Toronto treats cases of cheating and plagiarism very seriously. Please take the time to review the Academic Integrity website: http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/academic-integrity/students.
Common trends in academic offences:
 Plagiarizing/concocted references
 Collaboration/unauthorized assistance
 Purchasing work
 Recycling work or "double dipping"
 Resubmission of altered work for re-grading
 Use of electronic devices (cell phones) or any unauthorized aids
 Altering medical certificates and UofT documents
From the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters: “It shall be an offence for a student to knowingly: represent as one's own any idea or expression of an idea or work of another in any academic examination or term test or in connection with any other form of academic work, i.e., to commit plagiarism. Wherever in the Code an offence is described as depending on "knowing”, the offence shall likewise be deemed to have been committed if the person ought reasonably to have known.” All students must refer to this website to obtain information on what constitutes plagiarism: http://www.writing.utoronto.ca/advice/using-sources/how-not-to-plagiarize. If questions arise after reading the material on the website, consult your instructor. Plagiarism will not be tolerated.
Academic Rights
You, as a student at UTM, have the right to:
 Receive a syllabus by the first day of class.
 Rely upon a syllabus once a course is started. An instructor may only change assignments by following the University Assessment and Grading Practices Policy provision 1.3.
 Refuse to use turnitin.com (you must be offered an alternative form of submission).
 Have access to your instructor for consultation during a course or follow up with the department chair if the instructor is unavailable.
 Ask the person who marked your term work for a re-evaluation if you feel it was not fairly graded. You have up to one month from the date of return of the item to inquire about the mark. If you are not satisfied with a re-evaluation, you may appeal to the instructor in charge of the course if the instructor did not mark the work. If your work is remarked, you must accept the resulting mark. You may only appeal a mark beyond the instructor if the term work was worth at least 20% of the course mark.
 Receive at least one significant mark (15% for H courses, 25% for Y courses) before the last day you can drop a course for H courses and the last day of classes in the first week of January for Y courses taught in the Fall/Winter terms.
 Submit handwritten essays so long as they are neatly written.
Summer 2019 - Department of Psychology Page 5
 Have no assignment worth 100% of your final grade.
 Not have a term test worth 25% or more in the last two weeks of class.
 Retain intellectual property rights to your research.
 Receive all your assignments once graded.
 View your final exams. To see a final exam, you must submit an online Exam Reproduction Request within 6 months of the exam. There is a small nonrefundable fee.
 Privacy of your final grades.
 Arrange for representation from Downtown Legal Services (DLS), a representative from the UTM Students’ Union (UTMSU), and/or other forms of support if you are charged with an academic offence.
