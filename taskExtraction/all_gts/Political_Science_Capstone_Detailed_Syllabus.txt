Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve the design and execution of a research project or
advocacy campaign on a political issue. The project will be divided into the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Submit a proposal that outlines the political issue being addressed, the research question or
advocacy goal, and a detailed timeline. Assign roles and responsibilities within the group.
2. **Research and Data Collection (Weeks 4-6):**
- Conduct thorough research and data collection on the political issue, including literature reviews,
surveys, interviews, or case studies.
3. **Analysis and Strategy Development (Weeks 7-10):**
- Analyze the data collected to identify key insights and trends. Develop a strategy for addressing
the political issue, whether through policy recommendations, public awareness campaigns, or other
advocacy methods.
4. **Implementation and Outreach (Weeks 11-12):**
- Implement the strategy developed, including outreach efforts to stakeholders, policymakers, or
the public. Monitor the impact of the outreach.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the research process, analysis, and outcomes in a final report.
- Prepare a poster and presentation for the Innovation Showcase that effectively communicates
the project's findings and recommendations.
Groups will need to collaborate closely and meet regularly to ensure progress. Instructor check-ins
will be provided to offer guidance and address any issues that arise.
