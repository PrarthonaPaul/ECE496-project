Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on the development and implementation of pharmacovigilance plans
for newly approved drugs. Students will design a pharmacovigilance system, collect and analyze
safety data, and implement risk mitigation strategies, culminating in a presentation of their findings
at the Innovation Showcase. The course includes the development of a project proposal, risk
assessment, data collection, and a final report.
Course Objectives:
Develop and implement a pharmacovigilance plan for a newly approved drug.
Monitor and analyze safety data from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance.
Identify safety signals and implement risk mitigation strategies.
Effectively present the project at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in pharmacovigilance and drug safety monitoring.
Develop practical skills in risk assessment and management.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage pharmacovigilance projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve the development of a pharmacovigilance plan for a
newly approved drug. The project will be broken down into the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal detailing the drug, the pharmacovigilance plan, and the anticipated outcomes.
Include a timeline and assign roles to team members.
2. **Literature Review and Risk Assessment (Weeks 4-6):**
- Conduct a thorough literature review to identify potential risks and adverse effects associated
with the drug. Develop a risk assessment and management plan.
3. **Data Collection and Monitoring (Weeks 7-10):**
- Design a pharmacovigilance system for monitoring adverse events. Collect and analyze data
from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance.
4. **Signal Detection and Risk Mitigation (Weeks 11-12):**
- Identify safety signals and implement risk mitigation strategies. Update the pharmacovigilance
plan based on the findings.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire pharmacovigilance process, including challenges, solutions, and outcomes
in a final report.
- Prepare a presentation and poster for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of
the project.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
