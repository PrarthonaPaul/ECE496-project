Course Description
This fi rst-year course introduces students to the basics of chemical engineering design. Students work in teams todesign a simple chemical process, such as water purifi cation or biofuel production, based on a real-world problem.
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1.
Understand the fundamentals of chemical engineering principles.
2.
Apply process design and simulation techniques.
3.
Consider safety and environmental impacts in chemical engineering design.
4.
Work effectively in teams to solve engineering problems.
5.
Communicate design concepts and results through written reports and oral presentations.
