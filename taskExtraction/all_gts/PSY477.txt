Course Description:
This course involves a review of research and theory in a variety of applied topics from a systems
perspective. Students will identify human systems engineering project topic, write a proposal
with timeline, complete a project based on research and/or experience in an applied setting, write
a report on the project, and give an “elevator pitch” and a poster presentation at Innovation
Showcase. These activities will be accomplished in several group meetings as well as individual
meetings with the instructor. Prerequisite: Human Systems Engineering major, Senior standing.
Course Objectives:
Students will carry out an HSE capstone project and that includes a capstone project proposal,
report, and poster that is presented at the end of the semester at Innovation Showcase.

Academic Integrity:
Students in this class must adhere to ASU’s academic integrity policy, which can be found
at https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/policy). Students are responsible for reviewing this
policy and understanding each of the areas in which academic dishonesty can occur. In addition,
all engineering students are expected to adhere to both the ASU Academic Integrity Honor Code
and the Fulton Schools of Engineering Honor Code. All academic integrity violations will be
reported to the Fulton Schools of Engineering Academic Integrity Office (AIO). The AIO
maintains record of all violations and has access to academic integrity violations committed in all
other ASU college/schools.
Disruptive, Threatening, and Violent Behavior
Please note that the University policies against Disruptive, Threatening, and Violent behavior will
be enforced. Please review these in the Student Services Manual, SSM 104–02;
http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/ssm/ssm104-02.html Any violent or threatening conduct by an
ASU student in this class will be reported to the ASU Police Department and the Office of the
Dean of Students.
Cell phones and pagers must be turned off during class to avoid causing distractions. The use of
recording devices is not permitted during class. Any violent or threatening conduct by an ASU
student in this class will be reported to the ASU Police Department and the Office of the Dean of
Students.
Copyright
Course content, including lectures, are copyrighted materials and students may not share outside
the class, upload to online websites not approved by the instructor, sell, or distribute course
content or notes taken during the conduct of the course (see ACD 304–06, “Commercial Note
Taking Services” and ABOR Policy 5-308 F.14 for more information).
You must refrain from uploading to any course shell, discussion board, or website used by the
course instructor or other course forum, material that is not the student's original work, unless the
students first comply with all applicable copyright laws; faculty members reserve the right to
delete materials on the grounds of suspected copyright infringement.
Policy against threatening behavior, per the Student Services Manual, SSM 104–02
Students, faculty, staff, and other individuals do not have an unqualified right of access to
university grounds, property, or services. Interfering with the peaceful conduct of universityrelated
business or activities or remaining on campus grounds after a request to leave may be
considered a crime. All incidents and allegations of violent or threatening conduct by an ASU

student (whether on- or off-campus) must be reported to the ASU Police Department (ASU PD)
and the Office of the Dean of Students.
Harassment and Sexual Discrimination
Arizona State University is committed to providing an environment free of discrimination,
harassment, or retaliation for the entire university community, including all students, faculty
members, staff employees, and guests. ASU expressly prohibits discrimination, harassment,
and retaliation by employees, students, contractors, or agents of the university based on any
protected status: race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual
orientation, gender identity, and genetic information.
Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from
participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education
program or activity. Both Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual violence and
harassment based on sex is prohibited. An individual who believes they have been subjected to
sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling and
academic support, from the university. If you or someone you know has been harassed on the
basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources at
https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs.
Mandated sexual harassment reporter: As an employee of the University I am considered a
mandated reporter and therefore obligated to report any information regarding alleged acts of
sexual discrimination that I am informed of or have a reasonable basis to believe occurred.
ASU Counseling Services, https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling, is available if you wish to discuss any
concerns confidentially and privately.
Students with Disabilities:
Suitable accommodations will be made for students having disabilities. Students needing
accommodations must register with the ASU disabilities resource Center and provide
documentation of that registration to the instructor. Students should communicate the need for an
accommodation in sufficient time for it to be properly arranged.
Syllabus:
Any information in this syllabus (other than grading and absence policies) may be subject
to change with reasonable advance notice.
Absences
As a rule of thumb, to get participation points for the class and individual meetings you need to 1)
show up, and 2) contribute something to each class period (even one comment). Individual
meetings can be rescheduled as long as you notify me ahead of time. Partial credit can be
obtained for an excused absence in exchange for additional work on the part of the student
(assignment, essay). Accommodations will be made for religious observances provided that
students notify the instructor at the beginning of the semester concerning those dates.
Students who expect to miss class due to officially university-sanctioned activities should
inform the instructor early in the semester. Alternative arrangements will generally be
made for any examinations and other graded in-class work affected by such absences.
The preceding policies are based on ACD 304–04, “Accommodation for Religious
Practices” and ACD 304–02, “Missed Classes Due to University-Sanctioned Activities.”

Standard rules of rounding will apply, so .5 and above will be rounded up to the next whole
number. Top 3 values in each grade bracket (and 100) are assigned a “+”. Bottom 3 values in
each grade bracket are assigned a “-“ .
Class meeting grade includes following-up on assignments given the class meeting before and
being prepared to discuss your project and any other assignments in class. Participation in class
discussion is important and not possible without class attendance.
Individual meeting grade includes emailing me (ncooke@asu.edu) to set up individual meetings
convenient for both of us within the time frame allotted, in order to discuss progress on your
project. It is also possible to set up individual meetings at the end of the group class period. We
will typically meet in my SANCA 150B office, but can discuss alternative locations if that is not
possible. Please let me know ahead of time (early AM that day) if you need to change your
individual meeting time.
Projects are the main focus of this class and are to be a culmination of your studies and
experience in industrial organizational psychology or human systems engineering. We will
discuss the projects and progress toward them frequently and will use the group as a sounding
board for issues, ideas and decisions regarding the projects. There will be much flexibility in
terms of content and style of projects. Team projects are acceptable, however, each project will
be graded as a unit and each team member will be assigned the same points. There are a number
of project milestones to ensure that you get started early and maintain some level of activity
throughout the semester. A written proposal (3-5 double-spaced pages) will be required which
will then be revised based on comments that you receive from me and from the class. A final
written report (10 double-spaced pages), oral presentation (2 min elevator pitch), and a poster to
be presented at Innovation Showcase will be due at the end of the semester.
