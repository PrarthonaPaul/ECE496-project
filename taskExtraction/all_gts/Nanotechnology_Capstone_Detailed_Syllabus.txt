Course Description:
This capstone course explores the development of nanoscale devices and materials with
applications in various fields such as medicine, electronics, and energy. Students will design,
fabricate, and characterize a nanoscale device or material that addresses a specific challenge. The
course includes the development of a project proposal, fabrication, testing, and presentation of
findings through a report and at the Innovation Showcase.
Course Objectives:
Design and fabricate a nanoscale device or material with real-world applications.
Characterize and test the device's performance using advanced techniques.
Optimize the device or material for improved performance.
Effectively present the project at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in nanotechnology design and fabrication.
Develop practical skills in material characterization and testing.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage nanotechnology projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve the design and fabrication of a nanoscale device or
material with potential applications in medicine, electronics, or energy. The project will be divided
into the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Submit a proposal that outlines the nanoscale problem being addressed, the proposed device or
material, and a detailed timeline. Assign roles and responsibilities within the group.
2. **Design and Fabrication (Weeks 4-6):**
- Design the nanoscale device or material, including selecting appropriate materials and
fabrication techniques. Develop prototypes and test their functionality.
3. **Characterization and Testing (Weeks 7-10):**
- Characterize the nanoscale device or material using advanced techniques such as electron
microscopy or spectroscopy. Conduct tests to evaluate its performance.
4. **Optimization and Refinement (Weeks 11-12):**
- Optimize the device or material for improved performance. Refine the fabrication process based
on test results.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire development process, including design decisions, challenges, and
outcomes in a final report.
- Prepare a poster and presentation for the Innovation Showcase that effectively communicates
the project's impact.
Groups will need to collaborate closely and meet regularly to ensure progress. Instructor check-ins
will be provided to offer guidance and address any issues that arise.
