Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on addressing global health challenges through the design and
implementation of public health interventions. Students will develop and implement a project that
targets a specific global health issue, with an emphasis on research, planning, and evaluation. The
course includes the development of a project proposal, implementation, monitoring, and
presentation of findings through a report and at the Innovation Showcase.
Course Objectives:
Design and implement a public health intervention that addresses a global health issue.
Conduct a thorough needs assessment and plan for the intervention.
Evaluate the impact of the intervention on the target population.
Effectively present the project at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in global health challenges and intervention strategies.
Develop practical skills in public health planning, implementation, and evaluation.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage global health projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will focus on designing and evaluating a public health intervention
that addresses a global health challenge. The project will be divided into the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Submit a proposal that outlines the global health issue being addressed, the proposed
intervention, and a detailed timeline. Assign roles and responsibilities within the group.
2. **Needs Assessment and Planning (Weeks 4-6):**
- Conduct a needs assessment in the target population or region and develop a detailed plan for
the intervention, including strategies for implementation and evaluation.
3. **Implementation (Weeks 7-10):**
- Implement the public health intervention in a controlled or simulated environment. Collect
preliminary data on the intervention's effectiveness.
4. **Evaluation and Feedback (Weeks 11-12):**
- Evaluate the outcomes of the intervention using the data collected. Identify successes,
challenges, and areas for improvement.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire project process, including design decisions, challenges, and outcomes in a
final report.
- Prepare a poster and presentation for the Innovation Showcase that effectively communicates
the project's impact on global health.
Groups will need to collaborate closely and meet regularly to ensure progress. Instructor check-ins
will be provided to offer guidance and address any issues that arise.
