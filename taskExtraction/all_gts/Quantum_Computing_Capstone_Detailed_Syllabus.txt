Course Description:
This capstone course explores the application of quantum computing to solve complex problems.
Students will design, implement, and test a quantum algorithm or system that addresses a specific
challenge in the field. The course includes the development of a project proposal, algorithm design,
quantum implementation, and presentation of findings through a report and at the Innovation
Showcase.
Course Objectives:
Design and implement a quantum algorithm to solve a complex problem.
Conduct simulations and performance analysis of quantum systems.
Optimize the quantum algorithm for efficiency and accuracy.
Effectively present the project at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in quantum computing algorithms and systems.
Develop practical skills in quantum algorithm design and optimization.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage quantum computing projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve the development and implementation of a quantum
algorithm or quantum system to solve a complex problem. The project will be broken down into the
following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal outlining the quantum problem being addressed, the proposed quantum
solution, and the anticipated impact. Include a timeline and assign roles to team members.
2. **Algorithm Design and Simulation (Weeks 4-6):**
- Design the quantum algorithm or system, and develop a simulation to test its functionality in a
classical environment before implementation on a quantum computer.
3. **Quantum Implementation (Weeks 7-10):**
- Implement the quantum algorithm on a quantum computing platform. Test and refine the
algorithm to ensure it meets the project's objectives.
4. **Performance Analysis and Optimization (Weeks 11-12):**
- Analyze the performance of the quantum algorithm, identify areas for optimization, and make
necessary improvements.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire development process, including design decisions, challenges, and
outcomes in a final report.
- Prepare a presentation and poster for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of
the project.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
