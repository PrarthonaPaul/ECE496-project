COURSE DESCRIPTION
This is a required course for 3-credits in each semester of a two-semester capstone design course sequence.
COURSE OBJECTIVES
The overall course objective is to provide students the opportunity to learn what is expected of entry-level, and more experienced, engineers working in professional engineering and construction practice and offer opportunity for students to develop their skills to meet and excel in those expectations. This objective is pursued by providing opportunity for students:
1)
To experience and learn about civil and environmental engineering “project work” through doing it. The different facets of “project work” will include learning what the client needs, technical problem solving, analysis and design, as well as non-technical aspects (e.g. communication, teamwork, leadership, ethics, and following professional standards of practice).
2)
To follow a systems approach to problem solving by investigating social, regulatory, environmental, economic, and overall sustainability aspects of assignments and projects.
3)
To design engineering systems that include considerations of risk, uncertainty, sustainability, life-cycle principles, and environmental impacts.
4)
To learn how effective engineering leaders conduct themselves both on project levels, and on entrepreneurial and policy making levels, and the importance of high standards of ethical practice.
5)
To apply civil and environmental engineering design principles in a comprehensive project typically involving two or more sub-disciplines of civil engineering (e.g. transportation, geotechnical, structural, environmental) and/or environmental engineering (e.g. water, land, air). Projects may involve other interdisciplinary components.
6)
To learn and practice skills for communicating in written and graphic formats using notes, sketches, drawings, plan sheets, specifications, and reports explaining their design and construction recommendations.
7)
8)
To learn and then rigorously practice skills for successfully working in teams.
To learn and practice skills for communicating in one-on-one settings such as with clients and colleagues and in formal presentations such as to a review panel of faculty and practitioners.
COMMUNITY SERVICE LEARNING PROJECTS: This course is structured around real projects for community and nonprofit partners in a service-learning format. Service-learning is a form of experiential education in which students engage in activities that address human and community needs together with structured opportunities intentionally designed to promote student learning of academic materials and personal development. Research has shown that service learning promotes student learning and development in areas such as academic and intellectual development, civic engagement, career development, ethical judgment, and personal/interpersonal skills. Service learning is a two-way process in which students provide a service which offers them learning opportunities from both doing the work and interacting with their community partner clients.
Successful project experiences require students to reach out to their clients with frequent and meaningful communication, and above-and-beyond effort to understand and then meet their client’s needs. Following those precepts offers students an often-unique opportunity early in their engineering practice careers to experience working directly with high-level client managers, something that can otherwise sometimes take several years after graduation.
COURSE POLICIES
STUDENT ACCESSIBILITY SERVICES: In keeping with University policy, any student with a documented disability interested in utilizing accommodations should contact ACCESS, the office of Disability Services on campus. ACCESS works with students to create reasonable and appropriate accommodations via an accommodation letter to their professors as early as possible each semester. Contact ACCESS: A170 Living/Learning Center; 802-656-7753; access@uvm.edu; or www.uvm.edu/access.
ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION: Every class and recitation counts. Prompt attendance is expected and counts in your grade. If you cannot make a class or will be late, notify the TA by email sufficiently before the class. Absences will only be excused for appropriate circumstances.
RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS: Students have the right to practice the religion of their choice. You should submit in writing to me by the end of the second full week of classes your documented religious holiday schedule for the semester so we can develop a plan to accommodate that schedule.
WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS: Submit all assignments per the instructions. Late submittals without adequate prior explanation and approval by the instructor are not acceptable and will not be graded.
BLACKBOARD: Please check Blackboard for important correspondence and course updates. Blackboard will be generally be used to notify you of class messages regarding assignment changes or notices. Also, check your e-mail regularly for similar information. In the event of inclement weather, please check your Blackboard e-mail for any notice of cancellation or delay of class and/or activities.
SYLLABUS: This syllabus is subject to change with verbal and electronic notice.
ACADEMIC HONESTY: The University of Vermont and the College Engineering & Mathematical Sciences are learning communities. Consistent with the University’s mission and purpose, and the values the College seeks to foster within its community, we expect that academic honesty and integrity guide the actions of all its members. It is the responsibility of every person in the academic community to ensure that dishonesty is NOT tolerated. Academic dishonesty (cheating and/or plagiarism) violates the Academic Integrity Policy and may result in an “F” on the work involved or in the course. Cheating not only violates the Academic Integrity Policy, but also may be grounds for probation, suspension, and/or expulsion.

Attendance will be given full credit provided there are no unexcused absences. No attendance credit will be given if there are more than three unexcused absences. Anything between will receive credit at the instructor’s discretion.
Project submittals will be graded according to the attached grading rubric.
The final project grade given to each student on a team will be based on their performance within the team as reflected by peer reviews, client reviews, and instructor observations. High performing team members will receive the same grade as the project receives. Under-performing team members will have grades which are lower than the project grade, dependent on how much they contributed to the success of the project.
Final numeric percentages will translate into final letter grades as follows:
98-100 = A+; 93-97 = A; 90-92 = A-
88-89 = B+; 83-87 = B; 80-82 = B-
78-79 = C+; 73-77 = C; 70-72 = C-
68-69 = D+; 63-67 = D; 60-62 = D-

Executive Summary – This is a synopsis of the project and work performed. Explain the more important aspects and conclusions of the report. Include costs and final recommendations. This section has its own page following the title page.
Limitations. This section has its own page following the title page and must be included verbatim as stated below.
The intent of this report is to present the data collected, evaluations, analysis, design, cost estimates, and recommendations for the ____________ project. The work presented here was performed as a two-semester project as part of the CE 185 and 186 Capstone Design course sequence instructed by Professor John Lens. Although we have exercised care while working on all components of this project, the reader should be aware that the work was performed within a limited time period and with limited resources by students. This work was reviewed by Professor Lens, other UVM faculty and external evaluators; however, it has not been formally reviewed in sufficient extent suitable to be issued for final use and construction. The reader is advised that before using any part of this report, the work presented here must be independently evaluated by a qualified Professional Engineer licensed in project location, e.g., Vermont, New Hampshire, etc.
1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Reference the final scope of work from your Agreement (including any modifications) and place that in Appendix 1.
Provide a brief overview (~1-2 paragraphs) of how the project fits into a larger context and describe the project motivation as you understand it.
Introduce your specific project location (include map with north and scale) and photos.
Provide a summary of available data (e.g. maps, boring logs, accident data, and hydraulic flow records) and the data collected by the team (e.g. survey, traffic counts, water samples) and explain which was provided by your client and which you obtained on your own.
Explain and reference the field and laboratory data which you obtained for the project.
List and briefly explain the applicable design standards for your project work and what you have found to be the appropriate state of practice guidance for your key technical work. Where applicable, reference your literature research on the state of the practice/art for the key technical aspect(s) of your project.
2. EXISTING CONDITIONS, CONSTRAINTS, and IDENTIFIED NEEDS
This section summarizes conclusions about the existing conditions derived from the available data, cites and describes the constraints on the project, and what you identify to be the underlying needs which you address in your analysis of alternatives. Identify permitting constraints here. Discuss permitting considerations in detail either here or later in the report if that is more appropriate.

Provide enough explanation for your client and technical reviewers to understand what you did. Use photos, figures, and tables instead of writing, wherever appropriate.
4. ALTERNATIVE FINDINGS
Describe the findings from your analyses, and corresponding conclusions for each design alternative you consider. In addition to the technical considerations for alternatives, include specific constraints (e.g., permits, among other items) affecting for each design alternative considered. All necessary permits must be identified as much as possible and included in an appendix. Also include cost information applicable to your project. At minimum provide an analysis that puts all future operation, maintenance, expected upgrade costs on a present worth basis to add to initial capital costs. Show cost comparisons among design alternatives considered.
9. CONCLUSIONS and RECOMMENDATIONS
This section summarizes your conclusions from the alternatives analysis and your resulting recommendations. Include:
• Briefly stating the project objectives.
• Design alternatives considered.
• Alternatives ranking (from highest to lowest preference) including their advantages and disadvantages, and how they each address the stated project objectives. Include discussion on the uncertainty, risk, sustainability considerations, and life-cycle costs of each of the alternative.
• Your preferred alternative and why you recommend it.
• Recommendations for implementing your preferred alternative including measures to mitigate uncertainty and risk.
• Project operations and maintenance recommendations.

For example, do not just mention SLOPE/W and assume that the readers will know what it is; briefly describe it (e.g. SLOPE/W (reference) is a computer program that is based on limiting equilibrium method of two-dimensional slope stability analysis. It has a number of analysis methods including Morgernstern and Price, Spencer, …. The Morgernstern-Price method was selected because….).
• Data should be summarized in tables and graphs in the main body of the report with exhaustive details in relevant appendices. For example, if you conducted grain size analysis, the grain size curve can be included as a figure, but the data should be in an appendix.
• All tables must be numbered consecutively per section followed by a brief descriptive title (e.g. Table 3.1 – Soil parameters used in the slope stability analysis). The title should go above the table.
• Figures should also be numbered in the same way, (e.g. Figure 1.2 – Aerial view of Memorial Auditorium with planned parking lot highlighted). The figure titles should be under the figures.
• All fonts in table and figures must be large enough to be legible; all plots should have appropriate axis titles, units, etc.
• All figures and tables must be cited in the text before they appear in the body of the report.
• The layout of any design, to a reasonable scale, should always be included in the main report.
