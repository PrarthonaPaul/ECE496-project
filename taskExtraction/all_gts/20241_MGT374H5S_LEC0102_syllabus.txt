Course Description
Operations management is concerned with the facilities and their operation to deliver the goods and services of the organization.
The course develops this theme and gives a theoretical framework for managing operations. Some of the major themes include
aggregate planning, materials management, and inventory control. This course introduces students to modern quantitative and
computing tools necessary for in-depth operational analysis and planning.
Prerequisite: ECO220Y5 or ECO227Y5 or MGT218H5 or (STA256H5 and STA260H5) or STA218H5 or (STA256H5 and
STA258H5)
Exclusion: MGOC20H3 or RSM270H1 (SSc)
Distribution Requirement: SSc
Course Objective
This course will address operations analysis with emphasis on the service industry. The course content will focus on the overall
goal of planning and managing productivity, quality, and the efficiency and effectiveness of asset utilization. Specific topics
covered include operations analysis, project management, inventory management, the study of work and applied statistical analysis
and significance. Students will participate in a simulation game that will provide an opportunity practically apply many of these
concepts in a business type setting.
Some of the main objectives of the course will be:
To understand the unique characteristics of the service sector.
To understand the concept of productivity and the factors which impact it.
To understand the various methods used to improve productivity and their applications.
To understand the challenges that managers face in attempting to achieve service quality.
To understand the principles of service quality
Textbooks and Other Materials
We will use an Etext in this course along with the Connect online learning platform and an online simulation game. The access
code for the EText and Connect platform will be purchased from the bookstore. Instructions for the EText purchase and download
will be posted on the course website. The simulation can be purchased directly online. Students must acquire their own copies of
these materials as soon as possible as there is a significant amount of reading that will be required over the first few weeks. You
will be assigned a simulation ID that will allow you to access the simulation website. Note that the simulation operates on PCs, but
is not supported on Apple products (although some students have been able to use it, and some operate their Apple devices in PC
mode). Students are expected to come to class having done all assigned readings including any handouts.

Assessment and Grading Policies
Note that the Course Schedule, Assessment and Grading Policies detailed in this course outline are contingent on class delivery
staying unchanged. The course outline may change at the instructors' discretion under unforeseeable circumstances, e.g. lockdown
due to COVID. For example, if we are required to offer courses via remote delivery during the semester, the instructor will make
the necessary adjustments, including, but not limited to, the nature and timing of assignments and tests, reweighting of course
assessments, and other course content. These changes will be communicated via Quercus.
Requirements and Criteria
Simulation (ServiceSim)
Students will work in groups to create and manage the parts and service department of a new auto dealership throughout the
semester. For eight consecutive operating months you will make decisions about the direction and operations of your company.
Decisions will be electronically submitted to the simulation web site according to the attached course schedule. Late decisions will
result in a grade of zero for the round. Teams will receive their own results immediately after submitting their decisions for the
month, and will receive competitive information during the following class. Decision submission instructions and performance
measurement criteria will be discussed in class. All team members must have acquired a simulation access code and registered
online before the team will be able to submit decisions.
There will be a preliminary group mark determined for your simulation teams' performance. This group mark may then be
modified for each individual group member based on the results of a confidential peer evaluation. Students will receive an
individual mark (not a group mark) for the simulation which may, or may not, be the same as the group mark that is originally
determined or the mark given to other group members. This will help to recognize individual contributions and to promote equal
participation by group members. Students who do not contribute in a significant manner to their group may receive a grade for the
simulation as low as zero, at the discretion of the professor. Further instructions will be posted on the course website.
Students who have not registered for the simulation by January 29th, without prior permission from the instructor, and/or who do
not submit their simulation peer evaluation by the April 3rd deadline will receive a deduction of two marks (out of 24) from their
simulation grade for every whole or part day that it is late.
Weekly Quizzes
Students will complete ten quizzes worth 1.5 marks each throughout the semester that will test their knowledge on the designated
concepts. Each quiz will be open for a minimum of one week, and students will be provided with 45 minutes to complete each quiz
(each quiz should take much less time). Quizzes will be a combination of true/flase, multiple choice, and problem solving
questions. Students should read and follow the technology instructions, and complete the practice quiz, prior to attempting any quiz
to ensure compatability. Once a quiz has been started, a student cannot rewright the quiz. Becasue students have at least
one week to complete the quiz, no accommodations will be made for missed quizzes. Further instructions will be posted on the
course website.
Smartbook Submissions
For most EText chapter readings, the Connect online digital learning platform will provide a Smartbook study aid that will help
students deepen and strengthen their understanding of the EText material. Stuents will have at least one week to complete each
Smartbook assignment, and they must be completed along with the assigned readings by the day prior to the class covering the
subject. Students who complete each of the 13 Smartbook assignments can earn up to six marks based on their performance on their
best 12 Smartbook submissions to accommodate technical issues or other issues that may prevent a student from completing a
Smartbook assignment. Further instructions will be posted on the course website.
Midterm Exam and Final Exam
MGT374H5S - Swanston, David 2024-01-03 12:48:10 Page 2 of 10
The mid-term test is 60 minutes in duration and will be held in-class on Wednesday, February 7th. Material covered during all prior
classes is examinable on the midterm exam. Material covered after the midterm test is examinable on the final examination (noncumulative),
which will be scheduled during the final exam period and will be two hours in length. Exams will cover chapter
content, lectures, class discussion, alll other course material including the simulation.
For both exams, students will be permitted one 8.5x11 page of notes, two-side, and must be original hand-written (no copies,
printouts scans or computer generated notes). Students will also be allowed to use a non-programmable calculator and writing
materials. For missed midterms, students will write an altenate make-up midterm (scheduled on Monday February 12th at 9am) as
per the instructions below. Further instructions will be posted on the course website.
Conduct of Class
This course will require students to study the assigned text material and prepare exercises and case study analysis for in-class
discussion. The lectures and seminars will reinforce key concepts, expand on assigned readings and review topic applications.
Chapter content will not be given detailed review in class. Students are encouraged to ask questions and to participate in
discussions.
There are a variety of topics covered in this course and some students find it difficult to cover all of the material. Practical
application is the best method to learn the more quantitative topics so it is imperative that students do not fall behind in the chapter
readings. Preparing case analysis and completing assigned problems prior to class will help to identify areas where further
information is required and will provide the context for in-class discussion.
Procedures and Rules
Special Consideration Request for Academic Accommodation Request - Missed Tests & Quizzes (term work only, no final
exams):
To be considered for academic accommodation for missed tests and quizzes (ONLY), please follow the appropriate next steps
depending on your circumstance (i.e. illness related or non-illness related). Do NOT submit a petition for final exams. Final exam
deferrals must be submitted through the Registrar's Office. Extension of time requests should follow the same process.
Special Consideration Request Application: https://uoft.service-now.com/utm_scr
Illness or Non-illness Related Next Steps
1. Inform your professor in writing (e-mail is acceptable) no later than 24 hours after the test or quiz date of any
circumstances that prevent you from writing a test or quiz. Failure to do so will result in your special consideration request
petition being denied.
2. Submit an online Special Consideration Request as soon as possible, but no later than 72 hours after the test or quiz
date. Failure to do so will result in your request being denied. Special Consideration Request Application:
https://uoft.service-now.com/utm_scr
3. Provide your supporting documentation on the Special Consideration Request Application by attaching screenshots
or relevant documents within one week of the missed test/quiz. Supporting documentation may include a screenshot of
the Absence Declaration tool on ACORN. Please ensure the dates identified in your absence declaration include the actual
test or quiz date, if applicable. Please refer the course outline for term work exclusions from use of Absence
Declaration. The Department requires supporting documentation (such as Verification of Illness form) if your course
outline excludes test/quiz from the one-time ACORN declaration. Illness related documentation include the Verification
of Illness form which must be in English and completed by a practitioner registered and licensed in the Province of
Ontario with original signature and business stamp. Non illness related documentation will vary but a death in the family
requires submission of a death certificate. Requests without supporting documentation will be denied.
IMPORTANT
Failure to follow this process will result in your Special Consideration Request being denied.
If your form is not completed correctly with the necessary details to assess your Special Consideration Request, your
request may be denied.
In the case of an illness, you need to follow the specific Missed Tests requirements for your course (see Missed Tests
section below).
You may receive a follow up email or response on the Special Consideration Request Application from the UTMM
petitions committee. If so, you MUST respond within 24 hours.
If there is concern about your Special Consideration Request, your request may be refused and/or you may be asked to meet
with an Associate Chair or Program Director.
If you have multiple Special Consideration Requests your request may be refused.
If you do not complete the make-up work as and when required, you will receive a grade of zero for the original missed
MGT374H5S - Swanston, David 2024-01-03 12:48:10 Page 3 of 10
test; further special consideration is not permitted.
Holidays and pre-purchased plane tickets, family plans (unless critical, such as death of an immediate family member), your
friend's wedding, lack of preparation, or too many other tests are not acceptable excuses for missing a quiz, a test, or an item of
course work.
The written explanation and documentation that you submit represents an appeal from you, which requests the opportunity to
account for that portion of your grade in an alternate manner than the normal one that is described in this course outline. If an
appeal is not received by the deadline specified above, or if the appeal is deemed unacceptable, you will receive a grade of zero.
Missed Test(s):
Make-ups (Alternate Procedure): Students who miss the midterm exam due to illness and have submitted a Special Consideration
Request are expected to write a make-up test. Students should already have been prepared for the mid-term, so a make-up test will
be scheduled on Monday February 12th at 9 am (subject to room availability). As per the instructions above, Ill students must
contact the instructor in writing or via email within 24 hours so that arrangements can be made and your online petition must be
submitted.
Re-marking: Requests to have term tests remarked will be considered if the following conditions are met:
1. The request is submitted to the instructor no later than 7 days after the marked test has been reviewed by students and the
student has not written in pencil;
2. The student submits a written explanation with his remark request as to why and where he is entitled to more marks;
3. The instructor has no reason to believe the student has made any changes subsequent to the term test being returned.
Students should be aware of the following:
Several tests are randomly photocopied before being returned,
Items submitted for remarking will be remarked in their entirety and the mark awarded may increase, decrease, or remain
the same.
Late Assignment(s):
Students who do not submit their Smartbook assignments or quizzes by the due date will be assigned a grade of zero. Students who
have not registered for the simulation by January 29th, without prior permission from the instructor, and/or who do not submit their
simulation peer evaluation by April 3rd deadline will receive a deduction of two marks (out of 24) from their simulation grade for
every whole or part day that it is late. Teams that submit their decisions late for any round will result in a grade of zero for the
round.
Final Exams:
Students who cannot complete their final examination due to illness or other serious causes must file an online petition within 72
hours of the missed examination. Late petitions will NOT be considered. Upon approval of a deferred exam request, a nonrefundable
fee is required for each examination approved. See the Office of the Registrar Administrative Fees for Services page for
more information.
Academic Misconduct:
Academic integrity is essential to the pursuit of learning and scholarship in a university, and to ensuring that a degree from the
University of Toronto Mississauga is a strong signal of each student’s individual academic achievement. As a result, UTM treats
cases of cheating and plagiarism very seriously.
The University of Toronto’s Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters outlines behaviours that constitute academic dishonesty and
the process for addressing academic offences. Potential offences include, but are not limited to:
In papers and assignments:
Using someone else’s ideas or words without appropriate acknowledgement.
Submitting your own work in more than one course without the permission of the instructor.
Making up sources or facts.
Obtaining or providing unauthorized assistance on any assignment.
On tests and exams:
MGT374H5S - Swanston, David 2024-01-03 12:48:10 Page 4 of 10
1. Using or possessing unauthorized aids.
2. Looking at someone else's answers during an exam or test.
3. Misrepresenting your identity.
In academic work:
1. Falsifying institutional documents or grades.
2. Falsifying or altering any documentation required, including (but not limited to) doctor's notes.
Students should note that copying, plagiarizing, or other forms of academic misconduct will not be tolerated. Any student caught
engaging in such activities will be subject to academic discipline ranging from a mark of zero on the assignment, test or
examination to dismissal from the university as outlined in the academic handbook. Any student abetting or otherwise assisting in
such misconduct will also be subject to academic penalties.
Normally, students will be required to submit their course essays to the University's plagiarism detection tool for a review of textual
similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students will allow their essays to be included as source documents in
the tool’s reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism. The terms that apply to the
University’s use of this tool are described on the Centre for Teaching Support & Innovation web site (https://uoft.me/pdt-faq).
