Course Description
This course focuses on applying operations research techniques to real-world problems. Students work in teams totackle a project that involves formulating, solving, and analyzing an operations research problem. The courseemphasizes hands-on experience with optimization, simulation, and decision analysis.
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1.
Formulate operations research models for real-world problems.
2.
Apply optimization techniques to solve these models.
3.
Use simulation tools to analyze complex systems.
4.
Perform decision analysis to evaluate different solutions.
5.
Work effectively in teams to complete a project.
6.
Communicate project results through written reports and oral presentations.
