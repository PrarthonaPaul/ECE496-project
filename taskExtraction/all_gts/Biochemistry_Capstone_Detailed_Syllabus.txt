Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on the design and analysis of biochemical pathways or protein
structures with applications in medicine or biotechnology. Students will design and conduct
experiments or simulations to study a biochemical system, culminating in a presentation of their
findings at the Innovation Showcase. The course includes the development of a project proposal,
experimental design, data analysis, and a final report.
Course Objectives:
Design and analyze a biochemical pathway or protein structure.
Conduct experiments or simulations to study the system.
Compare experimental or computational results with existing models.
Effectively present the project at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in biochemistry and structural biology.
Develop practical skills in experimental design and data analysis.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage biochemistry projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve the design and analysis of a biochemical pathway or
protein structure with potential applications in medicine or biotechnology. The project will be broken
down into the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal outlining the biochemical pathway or protein structure being studied, the
proposed analysis, and the anticipated outcomes. Include a timeline and assign roles to team
members.
2. **Literature Review and Experimental Design (Weeks 4-6):**
- Conduct a thorough literature review to identify existing research and gaps. Design experiments
or computational models to study the pathway or protein structure.
3. **Experimentation or Simulation (Weeks 7-10):**
- Conduct experiments or simulations to study the pathway or protein. Collect data on enzyme
kinetics, binding affinities, or structural dynamics.
4. **Data Analysis and Interpretation (Weeks 11-12):**
- Analyze the data collected, interpret the results, and compare them to existing models or
theories. Refine the experiments or simulations based on the findings.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire research process, including design decisions, challenges, and outcomes in
a final report.
- Prepare a presentation and poster for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of
the project.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
