Course Format and Expectations
Overall
It is important that students are thoroughly familiar with the concepts introduced as all exams will be cumulative and will thus cover material from the beginning of the course to the lecture immediately prior to the exam, unless otherwise stated.
Tutorials
There will be 4 tutorials offered in this course, all conducted online. The tutorial leader will walk you through previously assigned problems. Full solutions to the tutorial questions will be posted after each tutorial. Additional information will be posted on Quercus.
Lecture Slides and Handouts
Pre-class lecture slides will be available on Quercus before each lecture. Lectures will emphasize interactive learning and focus on applications and problem solving.
.
Class Participation
Students are expected to prepare thoroughly and make every effort to attend every class. As class participation is a graded component of the course, students will be evaluated on the following:
• Thoughtful responses
• Understanding and analysis of topic
• Idea generation
• Promoting further discussion
For in-class discussions, students are expected to have read the chapter in advance to understand the basic concepts. Students should be prepared to contribute in-class examples and problems by bringing up issues or concerns on their own initiative and by being able to respond to questions and issues raised by other students and the professor. The success of the course for students depends on active, thoughtful participation and preparation by the members of the class.
Students are required to bring their name cards to every class and visibly display them. In order to earn participation marks, students must attend the section they are officially registered for.
Professionalism is a component of class contribution. Laptops should be used for class purposes only. Cell phones should not be used.
Post Class Homework (Wiley Plus Quizzes)

There will be 8 homework assignments in total, one for each topic (excluding the topic covered in the last lecture). Your 2 lowest scores will be dropped. Each submission is worth 2%. The solution to the quizzes will be released immediately following the due date. Late submissions will not be accepted and failure to successfully complete and submit your homework before the deadline will result in a mark of zero.

attempt per quiz, so make sure you are satisfied with your answers as you will not get a second attempt.

In such cases, students must:
1. Complete the Request for Special Consideration form: https://uoft.me/RSMConsideration
2. Provide documentation to support the request, e.g., Absence Declaration from ACORN, medical note etc.
Please note: As of September 2023, students may use the Absence Declaration on ACORN *one time per term* to report an absence and request consideration. Any subsequent absence will require a Verification of Illness form or other similar relevant documentation.
Students who do not submit their requests and documentation within 2 days may receive a grade of 0 (zero) on the missed course deliverable.

For the WileyPlus quizzes, an extension is not possible as the solutions are released immediately after the due date. If the student misses a quiz due to a legitimate reason, the weight of the missed assignment will be transferred to the final examination.
