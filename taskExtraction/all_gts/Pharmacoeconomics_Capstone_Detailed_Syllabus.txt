Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on the economic evaluation of pharmaceutical interventions or
healthcare policies. Students will conduct economic modeling and analysis, culminating in a
presentation of their findings at the Innovation Showcase. The course includes the development of a
project proposal, data collection, economic modeling, and a final report.
Course Objectives:
Evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of pharmaceutical interventions or healthcare
policies.
Develop economic models to analyze costs, health outcomes, and patient preferences.
Conduct scenario analyses to test the robustness of the economic models.
Effectively present the project at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in pharmacoeconomics and economic evaluation.
Develop practical skills in economic modeling and analysis.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage pharmacoeconomics projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve the economic evaluation of a pharmaceutical
intervention or healthcare policy. The project will be broken down into the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal detailing the pharmaceutical intervention or policy, the research objectives,
and the anticipated outcomes. Include a timeline and assign roles to team members.
2. **Literature Review and Data Collection (Weeks 4-6):**
- Conduct a thorough literature review to identify existing economic evaluations and gaps. Collect
data on costs, health outcomes, and patient preferences.
3. **Economic Modeling and Analysis (Weeks 7-10):**
- Develop economic models to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the
intervention or policy. Analyze the data to identify trends and make recommendations.
4. **Scenario Analysis and Optimization (Weeks 11-12):**
- Conduct scenario analyses to test the robustness of the economic models. Optimize the
intervention or policy based on the findings.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire economic evaluation process, including challenges, solutions, and
outcomes in a final report.
- Prepare a presentation and poster for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of
the project.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
