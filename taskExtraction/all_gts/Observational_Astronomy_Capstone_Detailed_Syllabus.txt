Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on the design and execution of an observational astronomy project.
Students will collect and analyze data from telescopes to study celestial objects, culminating in a
presentation of their findings at the Innovation Showcase. The course includes the development of a
project proposal, observing strategy, data reduction, and a final report.
Course Objectives:
Design and conduct an observational astronomy project using telescopes.
Reduce and analyze observational data to study celestial objects.
Interpret the data and test hypotheses about observed phenomena.
Effectively present the project at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in observational astronomy and data analysis.
Develop practical skills in telescope use and data reduction.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage astronomy projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve designing and conducting an observational astronomy
project using ground-based or space-based telescopes. The project will be broken down into the
following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal detailing the observational goals, the celestial objects being observed, and the
anticipated outcomes. Include a timeline and assign roles to team members.
2. **Observing Strategy and Data Collection (Weeks 4-6):**
- Develop an observing strategy, including the selection of instruments and scheduling of
observations. Collect data using ground-based or space-based telescopes.
3. **Data Reduction and Analysis (Weeks 7-10):**
- Reduce the observational data to remove noise and artifacts. Analyze the data to extract
meaningful information about the observed celestial objects.
4. **Interpretation and Hypothesis Testing (Weeks 11-12):**
- Interpret the results of the data analysis and test hypotheses about the observed phenomena.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire research process, including challenges, solutions, and outcomes in a final
report.
- Prepare a presentation and poster for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of
the project.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
