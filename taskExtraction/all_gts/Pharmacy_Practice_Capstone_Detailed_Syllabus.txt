Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on the development of comprehensive pharmacy practice models for
community or hospital settings. Students will design, simulate, and optimize a practice model,
culminating in a presentation of their findings at the Innovation Showcase. The course includes the
development of a project proposal, practice design, implementation strategy, and a final report.
Course Objectives:
Develop a comprehensive pharmacy practice model for a community or hospital setting.
Simulate and optimize the practice model based on feedback and data.
Create patient care protocols, workflow, and documentation strategies.
Effectively present the project at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in pharmacy practice and patient care models.
Develop practical skills in practice design and implementation.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage pharmacy practice projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve the development of a comprehensive pharmacy
practice model for a community or hospital setting. The project will be broken down into the following
subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal detailing the practice model, the target patient population, and the anticipated
outcomes. Include a timeline and assign roles to team members.
2. **Literature Review and Practice Design (Weeks 4-6):**
- Conduct a thorough literature review to identify best practices and gaps. Design the practice
model, including patient care protocols, workflow, and documentation.
3. **Implementation Strategy and Simulation (Weeks 7-10):**
- Develop an implementation strategy, including training materials and patient communication
plans. Simulate the practice model in a controlled environment.
4. **Outcome Evaluation and Optimization (Weeks 11-12):**
- Evaluate the outcomes of the simulated practice model and optimize it based on feedback and
data.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire development and simulation process, including challenges, solutions, and
outcomes in a final report.
- Prepare a presentation and poster for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of
the project.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
