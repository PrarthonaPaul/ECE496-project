Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on the analysis of genetic variation in populations or species.
Students will collect samples, extract DNA, analyze genetic data, and present their findings at the
Innovation Showcase. The course includes the development of a project proposal, sample
collection, genetic analysis, and a final report.
Course Objectives:
Analyze genetic variation in a specific population or species.
Collect samples, extract DNA, and conduct genetic analysis.
Test hypotheses about genetic variation and develop population genetics models.
Effectively present the research at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in genetics and population biology.
Develop practical skills in DNA extraction, genetic analysis, and bioinformatics.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage genetics research projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve the analysis of genetic variation in a specific population
or species. The project will be broken down into the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal detailing the population or species being studied, the research objectives, and
the anticipated outcomes. Include a timeline and assign roles to team members.
2. **Sample Collection and DNA Extraction (Weeks 4-6):**
- Collect samples from the population or species being studied. Extract DNA from the samples and
prepare them for analysis using techniques such as PCR and sequencing.
3. **Genetic Analysis and Data Interpretation (Weeks 7-10):**
- Analyze the genetic data to identify patterns of variation. Use bioinformatics tools to interpret the
data and compare it with known genetic markers.
4. **Hypothesis Testing and Population Genetics Modeling (Weeks 11-12):**
- Test hypotheses about genetic variation and evolutionary forces in the population. Develop
models of population genetics to explain the observed patterns.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire research process, including challenges, solutions, and outcomes in a final
report.
- Prepare a presentation for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of the
research.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
