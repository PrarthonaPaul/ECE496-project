Course Description
This course will challenge your views on a wide range of issues that affect us all. It will also excite your interest in a unique sociological way of understanding your world. The course showcases the eclectic nature of the discipline and the contemporary debates that animate it. We will examine what is “Canadian” culture, the role and impact of education and mass media on our lives, and the patterns of class, gender and racial and ethnic inequality in Canada and internationally. We will also take up the topic of health and mental health, crime and deviance, and politics and social movements to further our understandings of both the discipline of Sociology and the social worlds in which we live our lives. We may like to think of ourselves as perfectly free but powerful social forces open up some opportunities and close off others, constraining our freedom and helping to make us what we are.
Communication and Quercus
While this course involves a fair bit of independent learning, the organizing principle of the course is that learning is a social process that takes place not only by reading, attending lectures, listening to teaching assistants, but also by students interacting with each other. To foster a cooperative learning environment, this course is organized around a mix of lectures, in-class engagement, and outside-of-class participation. The course will rely heavily on the UofT LMS (Learning Management System) Quercus to facilitate this “study group” atmosphere. The Quercus page for this course will act as the “nervous system” of the course, a place where you will find this syllabus, PowerPoint slides (a partial set will be posted before the lectures and a full set by the next morning), assignment instructions, announcements, grades, and student-generated content on a series of discussion boards. While the Quercus page will be small at the outset, it will grow as the course progresses. Students should make use of the thread subscription function and the search engine within the Quercus to navigate the course page. Beyond that, we will rely on several other communication mechanisms to ensure all students have the information they need to be successful and for information to be delivered consistently to everyone.
To that end, there are several key resources for students in this course:
2
1) Announcements – The SOC100H Quercus page contains an “Announcements” tab. You should check the Announcement tab regularly. It will be the main mechanism to communicate about course-related matters. This is where all deadlines, new content, instructions, grade releases, and any other pertinent information will be posted. Treat the Announcement tab as a series of appendices to this syllabus.
2) General Questions about the Course – From our course home page on Quercus, you will see a “Discussions” tab on the left-hand side. The forum General Questions about the Course is pinned at the top. It is the main space on Quercus that you will use for course-related, non-personal questions. This is the quickest way to get a reply to a question: the go-to place for all questions about course content, activities, assignment, exams, deadlines, etc. This forum is monitored mainly by Professor Caron and Professor McIvor, along with the TAs. Every question will be answered by one of us unless a colleague has already provided the answer. In this way, all clarifications are available to everyone in the course.
Additionally, each lecture topic will also have its own substantive discussion board which is a great place to discuss course materials from readings and lectures, and ask questions about each of the substantive topics we are covering this semester. Please also note that you can subscribe to the different discussion boards by clicking the subscribe button found within each; you will then receive alerts when questions are asked and/or answered.
3) TAs – Each student has signed up on ACORN for a tutorial, which means that you have your own tutorial TA. Your tutorial TA will help you all semester as an additional resource for the course. You have access to your tutorial TA through six tutorials (see Appendix 3 for tutorial details). In most of the weeks without tutorials, we offer over 30h of in-person and online office hours. You have access to and are welcome to attend any of these office hours to seek assistance or ask questions from any of the TAs (see Appendix 2 for a list of office hours) (for more personal matters to be handled by e-mail, you should contact the Lead TA, Maria Finnsdottir)
4) Maria Finnsdottir - as the Lead TA, Maria does not have her own tutorial students. Instead, she will assist the other TAs in their tasks and be an additional resource for all students in the course. She’s the TA to contact if you want to reach out by e-mail with a question or issue you prefer not posting on Quercus or asking your TA in-person. Maria is also responsible for all administrative matters related to peer contribution grading, tests and exams, submission issues, all grade reviews, special accommodations, missing grades, deadlines, etc. You should feel free to contact her by e-mail if you have any questions or concerns about any of these matters.
5) Professor Caron & Professor McIvor – as the Course Instructors, the Professors are ultimately responsible for every aspect of the course. You are encouraged to seek them out after class or during office hours. If you have any questions or concerns about any aspects of the course, or anything else you might want to discuss privately, feel free to e-mail them. E-mails are typically answered within 2 business days (i.e. 2 days not counting Saturday and Sunday).

Course Material
Our course textbook is Ravelli, Bruce & Michelle Webber. Exploring Sociology: A Canadian Perspective, 5th Edition. (North York: Pearson Canada, 2022). The textbook is an etext available for purchase or subscription through the UofT bookstore. You have two options for purchasing the book and either option is fine:
(1) You can purchase the text as an ebook that you have access to for 6 months (180 days), which is $53.00. The link for this option is here: https://www.uoftbookstore.com/product/61721
(2) Or you can purchase it as a downloadable ebook (you receive 2 downloads with this purchase) that you maintain access to permanently, which is $83.00. The link for this option is here: https://www.uoftbookstore.com/product/61722
Evaluation
Peer Contributions (5%) – (throughout semester)
Each student has had a rich life full of personal, educational, and work experiences before walking into this course, and is thus well equipped to contribute something worthwhile to their colleagues’ learning experience. This component is there to encourage each of you to make these contributions, while giving each student plenty of choices in the manner in which they feel most interested or most comfortable doing so. There are several distinctive ways for each of you to contribute to your colleagues’ experience and accrue these 5%: (1) you can be one of the volunteer note-takers; (2) you can answer your colleagues’ questions on your the General Questions about the Course forum, where each question answered will be credited 0.5%; (3) you can accrue contributions by posting relevant material, clarifications, or reflections on the course content, such as material and insights from other courses you have taken, from what you see in the media, or from your own first-hand experience. Every posts made on the substantive forums (Culture, Mass Media, Gender, Health, etc) that contributes to furthering the understanding of course material for your colleagues, and is no less than 100 words in length, will be credited 0.5% towards this component; and (4) you can also earn this 5% by suggesting other types of possible contributions to your TAs or instructor.
Tutorial (10%)
The tutorials are designed as part discussion groups, part Q+A, and part midterm and final exam prep. They each involve a tutorial activity assessed out of 2%. If you complete all six tutorial activities, then the best five grades out of six will be compiled to produce the total of out of 10%.

Academic Integrity
Students are expected to know and adhere to the University's principles of academic integrity. Any act of plagiarism or other unethical behavior will be addressed in accordance with University guidelines. Please see the "Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters" 6 (http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm) for specific information on academic integrity at the U of T.
Ouriginal
Sometimes, students will be required to submit their assignments to the University’s plagiarism detection tool for a review of textual similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students will allow their essays to be included as source documents in the tool’s reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of this tool are described on the Centre for Teaching Support & Innovation web site (https://uoft.me/pdt-faq).
For some of your assignments, we will be using the software Ouriginal. It uses text matching technology as a method to uphold the University’s high academic integrity standards to detect any potential plagiarism. Ouriginal is integrated into Quercus. For the assignments set up to use Ouriginal, the software will review your paper when you upload it to Quercus. To learn more about Ouriginal’s privacy policy please review its Privacy Policy.
Accessibility and Student Accommodations Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course.
