Course Description
This Construction Project capstone design course is intended to establish the foundation for
organizational and procedural understanding in construction engineering. The student will gain the
knowledge necessary to apply engineering principles in analyzing economical approaches to construction
problems.
This course will cover construction methods, equipment, and cost estimation of construction materials,
excavation, foundation, retaining walls, formwork, pavements and other aspects of civil engineering
construction projects by integrating geotechnical reports, materials specifications, quality control,
equipment, estimation, scheduling, and design details.
Course Content
This course is focused on building upon your existing knowledge of construction, geotechnical and
materials engineering. There will be a series of assignments and projects that will enhance your current
level of knowledge.
Selected topics will be chosen for detailed lectures as given below. The lectures may not be held in the exact
order listed, but will be ordered to supplement the capstone project. The number of lectures on each topic
may vary slightly, to accommodate student and project background and needs. Lecture topics may be
deleted, modified or added at the discretion of the lecturer.

Planned Course Outcomes
Students enrolled in C E 438W should gain or enrich:
• An ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs
• An ability to function on multi-disciplinary teams
• An ability to communicate effectively
• An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility
• A knowledge of contemporary issues
• A recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning
Specific Course Goals and Objectives
• Expand knowledge and understanding of construction engineering within the framework of a
realistic major design/construction project
• Advance proficiency with use of specifications, bid documents, planning and scheduling tools,
estimating tools, site investigation techniques
• Apply project management process and procedures, geotechnical, pavement and materials
design and constructability techniques
• Develop an appreciation for the role of professional and ethical responsibility in engineering
and construction management practice

Additional course information:
Homework assignments will be given in class with no written description; it is your responsibility to take
proper notes. If you have any questions, ask. All assignments are due at the start of the class period.
Scores on late homework assignments will be reduced. Prepare all homework solutions and projects in a
professional manner. No late project submissions will be accepted.
Lecture notes will be posted on ANGEL.
Class attendance is critical to the successful completion of this course; attendance will be checked
periodically and used as part of the student’s grade. All students must actively participate in class .
Final letter grades in the course will be assigned as follows:
93.0 < A < 100 80.0 < B- < 83.0 F < 60.0
90.0 < A- < 93.0 77.0 < C+ < 80.0
87.0 < B+ < 90.0 70.0 < C < 77.0
83.0 < B < 87.0 60.0 < D < 70.0
Academic Integrity
Students are expected to uphold the highest academic integrity. Any deviation will result in disciplinary
measures consistent with University policies, including a grade of zero points for that assignment and
potentially a failing grade in the class.
Please consult the policies at http://www.engr.psu.edu/CurrentStudents/acadinteg.asp
Writing Across the Curriculum
Developing the skill to communicate by means of the written word is extremely important.
This course has been designated as a "W" courses and it will include writing assignments that relate
clearly to the course objectives and serve as effective instruments for learning the subject matter of the
course. These assignments are designed to help students investigate the course subject matter, gain
experience in interpreting data or the results of research, shape writing for a particular audience, or
practice the type of writing associated with a given profession or discipline. It is highly recommended
that the student make use of writing and learning centers.
