Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on the study of large-scale structures and the evolution of the
universe. Students will analyze data from cosmic microwave background observations, galaxy
surveys, and simulations, culminating in a presentation of their findings at the Innovation Showcase.
The course includes the development of a project proposal, data collection, modeling, and a final
report.
Course Objectives:
Study the large-scale structure and evolution of the universe.
Analyze observational data and develop cosmological models.
Compare data with theoretical predictions and test hypotheses.
Effectively present the project at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in cosmology and data analysis.
Develop practical skills in modeling and hypothesis testing.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage astronomy projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve the study and analysis of large-scale structure and the
evolution of the universe. The project will be broken down into the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal outlining the cosmological phenomena being studied, the research objectives,
and the anticipated outcomes. Include a timeline and assign roles to team members.
2. **Data Collection and Analysis (Weeks 4-6):**
- Collect data from cosmic microwave background observations, galaxy surveys, and other
sources. Analyze the data to study the distribution of matter and energy in the universe.
3. **Modeling and Simulation (Weeks 7-10):**
- Develop models and simulations to understand the formation and evolution of cosmic structures.
Compare the models with observational data.
4. **Hypothesis Testing and Interpretation (Weeks 11-12):**
- Test hypotheses about the origin and evolution of the universe. Interpret the results in the
context of current cosmological theories.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire research process, including challenges, solutions, and outcomes in a final
report.
- Prepare a presentation and poster for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of
the project.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
