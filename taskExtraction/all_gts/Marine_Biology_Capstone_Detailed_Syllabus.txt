Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on the study of marine ecosystems and species. Students will
conduct fieldwork, collect and analyze data, and present their findings at the Innovation Showcase.
The course includes the development of a project proposal, fieldwork, data analysis, and a final
report.
Course Objectives:
Study and analyze marine ecosystems and species.
Conduct fieldwork in marine environments to collect data.
Develop and test ecological models of marine ecosystems.
Effectively present the research and conservation plan at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in marine biology and ecological modeling.
Develop practical skills in fieldwork, data analysis, and conservation planning.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage marine biology research projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve the study of marine ecosystems and the organisms
within them. The project will be broken down into the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal detailing the marine ecosystem or species being studied, the research
objectives, and the anticipated outcomes. Include a timeline and assign roles to team members.
2. **Fieldwork and Data Collection (Weeks 4-6):**
- Conduct fieldwork in marine environments to collect data on species, habitats, and environmental
conditions. Use techniques such as scuba diving, underwater photography, and sample collection.
3. **Data Analysis and Ecosystem Modeling (Weeks 7-10):**
- Analyze the collected data using ecological models. Develop predictions about the health and
stability of the marine ecosystem and test these predictions using statistical methods.
4. **Hypothesis Testing and Conservation Planning (Weeks 11-12):**
- Test hypotheses about species interactions, environmental impacts, and conservation needs.
Develop a conservation plan based on the findings.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire research process, including challenges, solutions, and outcomes in a final
report.
- Prepare a presentation for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of the
research and conservation plan.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
