Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on addressing fundamental questions in astrophysics through the
design and analysis of models and experiments. Students will design, implement, and analyze an
astrophysical experiment or model that explores a key question in the field. The course includes the
development of a project proposal, model design, data analysis, and presentation of findings
through a report and at the Innovation Showcase.
Course Objectives:
Design and implement an astrophysical model or experiment.
Analyze and interpret data from simulations or observations.
Validate the model against real-world data or existing theories.
Effectively present the project at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in astrophysical modeling and data analysis.
Develop practical skills in experiment design and implementation.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage astrophysics projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve the design and analysis of an astrophysical model or
experiment that explores a fundamental question in the field. The project will be broken down into
the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal outlining the astrophysical question being addressed, the proposed model or
experiment, and the anticipated outcomes. Include a timeline and assign roles to team members.
2. **Model Design and Simulation (Weeks 4-6):**
- Design the astrophysical model or experiment, and develop simulations to test its validity.
Analyze data from existing telescopes or simulations to refine the model.
3. **Experiment Implementation (Weeks 7-10):**
- Implement the experiment or gather observational data. Test the model against real-world data to
validate or refine the hypothesis.
4. **Data Analysis and Interpretation (Weeks 11-12):**
- Analyze the data collected, interpret the results, and compare them to existing theories or models
in astrophysics.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire research process, including design decisions, challenges, and outcomes in
a final report.
- Prepare a presentation and poster for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of
the project.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
