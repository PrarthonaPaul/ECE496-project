Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on the development of biotechnology products or processes.
Students will design, develop, and validate a biotechnology product, culminating in a presentation at
the Innovation Showcase. The course includes the development of a project proposal, literature
review, product development, and a final report.
Course Objectives:
Develop a biotechnology product or process from concept to prototype.
Conduct market analysis and testing to validate the product.
Optimize the design and functionality of the biotechnology product.
Effectively present the product at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in biotechnology and product development.
Develop practical skills in research, product design, and testing.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage biotechnology projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve the development of a biotechnology product or process.
The project will be broken down into the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal detailing the biotechnology product or process being developed, the research
objectives, and the anticipated outcomes. Include a timeline and assign roles to team members.
2. **Literature Review and Market Analysis (Weeks 4-6):**
- Conduct a thorough literature review to understand the current state of the technology and
potential market applications. Develop a market analysis to identify potential users and competitors.
3. **Product Development and Prototyping (Weeks 7-10):**
- Develop a prototype of the biotechnology product or process. Optimize the design and
functionality based on initial testing and feedback.
4. **Testing and Validation (Weeks 11-12):**
- Conduct testing and validation studies to ensure the product meets the intended specifications
and regulatory requirements. Analyze the results and refine the product as needed.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire development process, including challenges, solutions, and outcomes in a
final report.
- Prepare a presentation for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of the
biotechnology product or process.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
