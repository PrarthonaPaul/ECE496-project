Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on the study of cellular processes and their implications for human
health and disease. Students will design experiments, collect and analyze data, and present their
findings at the Innovation Showcase. The course includes the development of a project proposal,
literature review, experimental design, and a final report.
Course Objectives:
Study cellular processes and their implications for human health.
Design and conduct experiments using cell biology techniques.
Analyze and interpret data in the context of human disease.
Effectively present the research at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in cell biology and experimental design.
Develop practical skills in data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage cell biology research projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve the study of cellular processes and their implications for
human health and disease. The project will be broken down into the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal detailing the cellular process being studied, the research objectives, and the
anticipated outcomes. Include a timeline and assign roles to team members.
2. **Literature Review and Hypothesis Development (Weeks 4-6):**
- Conduct a thorough literature review to understand the current knowledge about the cellular
process. Develop hypotheses based on gaps or unexplored areas in the literature.
3. **Experimental Design and Data Collection (Weeks 7-10):**
- Design experiments to test the hypotheses. Collect data using techniques such as fluorescence
microscopy, cell culture, and Western blotting.
4. **Data Analysis and Interpretation (Weeks 11-12):**
- Analyze the collected data using statistical methods. Interpret the results in the context of human
health and disease.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire research process, including challenges, solutions, and outcomes in a final
report.
- Prepare a presentation for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of the
research and its implications for human health.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
