ABET LEARNING OUTCOMES for BE, EE, CompE, MSE and ME:
Engineering programs must demonstrate that their students attain:
1. An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics. (ECE, ME, MSE)
2. An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors. (BE, ECE, ME, MSE)
3. An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences (BE, ECE, ME, MSE)
4. An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgements, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. (BE, ECE, ME, MSE)
5. An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives. (BE, ECE, ME, MSE)
6. An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions. (ECE, ME, MSE)
7. An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. (ECE, ME, MSE)
ABET LEARNING OUTCOMES for CS 480/481:
1. Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
2. Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.
3. Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.
4. Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.
5. Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’s discipline.

CAPSTONE PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS
We understand and value the learning outcomes for capstone design. We are committed to working together to achieve these at the highest possible level of performance. In doing this, we agree not to compromise the interests of our project sponsor(s), or the rights of other students and staff associated with the course.
As an engineering professional enrolled in this course, I WILL…
• Be tactful and honest in giving feedback; open-minded towards new ideas.
• Take responsibility for my actions as a prepared and trustworthy teammate.
• Proactively and resourcefully accept tasks and execute decisions.
• Fully apply all personal skills to produce high quality design work, putting interests of the team above self-interest.
As an engineering professional enrolled in this course, I WILL NOT…
• Fail to follow through on commitments I have made, leaving tasks incomplete.
• Exclude others from decision-making through poor communication.
• Assign blame to others, contributing to negative team/course energy.
• Be apathetic toward producing a high-quality product in a timely manner.
• Marginalize interests of other teams and instructional staff.
As a member of the instructional staff, I WILL…
• When requested, provide and accept honest feedback on performance.
• Take actions to promote self-directed learning and high-quality products.
• Mediate conflicts early, including team & customer issues.
• Clearly communicate course expectations and agendas for classes/meetings.
As a member of the instructional staff, I WILL NOT…

HEALTHY VANDAL POLICIES
It is a longstanding tradition that Vandals take care of Vandals, and we all do our best to look
out for the Vandal Family. These simple precautions go a long way in reducing the impact of
coronavirus on our campuses and in our communities. With everyone engaging in these small
actions, we can continue to participate in our vibrant campus culture where we are able to
learn, live, and grow. Please bookmark the University of Idaho Covid-19 webpage and visit it
often for the most up-to-date information about the U of I’s response to Covid-19.
• All classes are offered in the modality listed in the catalog.
• All Vandals are highly encouraged to be vaccinated.
• COVID-19 tests are not required to attend class in person.
Additionally, faculty and students must follow the Healthy Vandal Pledge:
Daily Symptom Monitoring and In-Person Class Attendance. Evaluate your own health status before attending in-person classes and refrain from attending class in-person if you are ill, if you are experiencing any of the known symptoms of coronavirus, or if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have been potentially exposed to someone with COVID-19.
1. Stay home if you experience any symptoms related to COVID 19 and that are not attributed to a non-infectious health condition regardless of how mild.
2. Contact your medical provider or local Idaho Public Health District for assessment of symptoms and possible COVID19 testing. Positive COVID 19 tests should be submitted via a VandalCare Report in order to make arrangements that involve classroom absences due to illness, and/or quarantine or isolation requirements directed by a medical provider.
