Dr. Kevin Coleman kevin.coleman@utoronto.ca Office: MN 4280

Optional Group Reading: 3:30-4:30pm in MN Historical Studies Meeting Room

COURSE DESCRIPTION AND LEARNING OUTCOMES
In twentieth-century Latin America, ordinary people—peasants, students, workers—organized to create more free and
equal societies. Their movements for social change were met by entrenched powers that wanted to preserve the status
quo. Over the next twelve weeks, we will examine the Cuban Revolution, Allende’s Chilean Road to Socialism, the
Pinochet dictatorship’s reign of terror, and the Salvadoran civil war. We’ll read about and discuss the lives of
extraordinary people, from Che Guevara and Salvador Allende to Augusto Pinochet and gang members in Los Angeles.
You will gain a nuanced understanding of the historiographies of three defining events in Latin American history.
But more importantly, I hope you gain an understanding of what we mean by the word historiography, and that you
acquire the skills you need—as a citizen, as a historically-minded person, as a thinker in the world—to quickly find and
evaluate the main contours of important debates and explanations of events. Those skills will serve you well, no matter
what you end up doing in life. We will also attend to the narrative techniques of two exemplary works of historical
nonfiction; doing so will enable us to become better readers and writers.

FOSTERING OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Normally, students will be required to submit their course essays to the University’s plagiarism detection tool for a
review of textual similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students will allow their essays to be
included as source documents in the tool’s reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of
detecting plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of this tool are described on the Centre for Teaching
Support & Innovation web site (https://teaching.utoronto.ca/ed-tech/teaching-technology/pdt/pdt-faq/).
EQUITY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND RESPECT FOR DIVERSITY
The University of Toronto is committed to equity, human rights and respect for diversity. All members of the learning
environment in this course should strive to create an atmosphere of mutual respect where all members of our
community can express themselves, engage with each other, and respect one another’s differences. U of T does not
condone discrimination or harassment against any persons or communities.
ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC SUPPORT
The Robert Gillespie Academic Skills Centre (RGASC) is located in Room 3251 on the third floor of the Maanjiwe
nendamowinan Building. The RGASC offers individual consultations, workshops (many CCR-accredited), and a wide
range of programs to help students identify and develop the academic skills they need for success in their studies. Their
programming will include both in-person and online options. Visit the RGASC website to explore their online
resources, book an in-person or online appointment, or learn about other programming such as Writing Retreats, the

ACADEMIC CONDUCT
As a student in this course, you have certain rights and responsibilities, some of which are outlined in the following
statement of academic integrity written by the University of Toronto’s Centre for Teaching Support and Innovation:
“Academic integrity is essential to the pursuit of learning and scholarship in a university, and to ensuring that a degree
from the University of Toronto Mississauga is a strong signal of each student’s individual academic achievement. As a
result, UTM treats cases of cheating and plagiarism very seriously.
The University of Toronto’s Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters outlines behaviours that constitute academic
dishonesty and the process for addressing academic offences. Potential offences include, but are not limited to:
• Accessing unauthorized resources (search engines, chat rooms, Reddit, etc.) for assessments.
Using technological aids (e.g. software) beyond what is listed as permitted in an assessment.
• Posting test, essay, or exam questions to message boards or social media.
• Creating, accessing, and sharing assessment questions and answers in virtual “course groups.”
• Working collaboratively, in-person or online, with others on assessments that are expected to be completed
individually.
All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be investigated following procedures outlined in the Code of
Behaviour on Academic Matters. If you have questions or concerns about what constitutes appropriate academic
behaviour or appropriate research and citation methods, you are expected to seek out additional information on
academic integrity from your instructor or from other institutional resources.”
POLICIES ON TESTS AND ASSIGNMENTS
If a deadline for an assignment is not met, the assignment is subject to a late penalty of 2% per day. Students may
request special consideration due to reasons beyond the student’s control, including illness or injury; religious
observances; other unplanned and/or unforeseeable circumstances entirely beyond the student’s control (e.g., a court
subpoena, a funeral, an accident, etc.). Reasons such as vacations, pre-purchased plane tickets, family plans, attendance
at a wedding, lack of preparation, technology failure, extra-curricular commitments, and academic work in other
courses are not considered to be beyond a student’s control and will not be accommodated.
Students are permitted to declare an absence on ACORN for up to 7 (seven) consecutive days that does not require
additional supporting documentation. However, you must still notify your instructor as soon as possible (within 3 days
of the missed deadline), and complete the online Special Consideration Request. This absence declaration tool may only
be used once per term.
If your absence exceeds 7 days, you may be asked to provide supporting documentation (e.g., Verification of Illness
Form or Verification of Extenuating Circumstances).
The ACORN absence declaration tool may NOT be used if the missed assessment is an in-class assignment.
Requests for additional extensions/accommodations, outside of this one-time only exception, must be submitted through
a Special Consideration Request. Please review the policy on our web site and follow the instructions to submit a
request directly to the Department.
Students may invoke the “stuff happens” clause on one and only one assignment to receive an automatic 3-day
extension, no questions asked. To invoke this clause, send an email to your professor before the assignment is due, and
cc your TA, stating the invocation of the clause.

The University of Toronto respects your privacy. The information on this form is collected pursuant to section 2(14) of

effort.
