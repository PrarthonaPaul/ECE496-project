Department of Mechanical Engineering - UT-Tyler - Senior Capstone Project Student Handbook Page 22 of 104
10. Grade Replacement/Forgiveness and Census Date Policies
Students repeating a course for grade forgiveness (grade replacement) must file a Grade Replacement
Contract with the Enrollment Services Center (ADM 230) on or before the Census Date of the semester in
which the course will be repeated. Grade Replacement Contracts are available in the Enrollment Services
Center or at http://www.uttyler.edu/registrar. Each semester’s Census Date can be found on the Contract
itself, on the Academic Calendar, or in the information pamphlets published each semester by the Office
of the Registrar.
Failure to file a Grade Replacement Contract will result in both the original and repeated grade being used
to calculate your overall grade point average. Undergraduates are eligible to exercise grade replacement
for only three course repeats during their career at UT Tyler; graduates are eligible for two grade
replacements. Full policy details are printed on each Grade Replacement Contract.
The Census Date is the deadline for many forms and enrollment actions of which students need to be
aware. These include:
• Submitting Grade Replacement Contracts, Transient Forms , requests to withhold directory
information, approvals for taking courses as Audit, Pass/Fail or Credit/No Credit.
• Receiving 100% refunds for partial withdrawals. (There is no refund for these after the Census
Date)
• Schedule adjustments (section changes, adding a new class, dropping without a “W” grade)
• Being reinstated or re-enrolled in classes after being dropped for non-payment
• Completing the process for tuition exemptions or waivers through Financial Aid
11. State-Mandated Course Drop Policy
Texas law prohibits a student who began college for the first time in Fall 2007 or thereafter from dropping
more than six courses during their entire undergraduate career. This includes courses dropped at another
2-year or 4-year Texas public college or university. For purposes of this rule, a dropped course is any
course that is dropped after the census date (See Academic Calendar for the specific date).
Exceptions to the 6-drop rule may be found in the catalog. Petitions for exemptions must be submitted to
the Enrollment Services Center and must be accompanied by documentation of the extenuating
circumstance. Please contact the Enrollment Services Center if you have any questions.
12. Disability/Accessibility Services
