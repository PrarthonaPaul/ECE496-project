Individual meeting grade includes emailing me (ncooke@asu.edu) to set up individual meetings convenient for both of us within the time frame allotted, in order to discuss progress on your project. It is also possible to set up individual meetings at the end of the group class period. We will typically meet in my SANCA 150B office, but can discuss alternative locations if that is not possible. Please let me know ahead of time (early AM that day) if you need to change your individual meeting time.: Relevant
33. Projects are the main focus of this class and are to be a culmination of your studies and experience in industrial organizational psychology or human systems engineering. We will discuss the projects and progress toward them frequently and will use the group as a sounding board for issues, ideas and decisions regarding the projects. There will be much flexibility in terms of content and style of projects. Team projects are acceptable, however, each project will be graded as a unit and each team member will be assigned the same points. There are a number of project milestones to ensure that you get started early and maintain some level of activity throughout the semester. A written proposal (3-5 double-spaced pages) will be required which will then be revised based on comments that you receive from me and from the class. A final written report (10 double-spaced pages), oral presentation (2 min elevator pitch), and a poster to be presented at Innovation Showcase will be due at the end of the semester.: Relevant
