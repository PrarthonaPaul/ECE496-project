CS 4704 
 
I. CATALOG DESCRIPTION 
 
Senior project course integrating software engineering knowledge and skills acquired in previous 
courses. Team-based approach to problem formulation, requirements engineering, architecture, 
design, implementation, integration, documentation and delivery of a software system that solves a 
real-world problem. Pre: C or better in 3704 (3H, 3C). 
 
 
Course Number:  4704 
 
 
ADP Title: Software Engineering Capstone 
 
II. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
 
Having successfully completed this course, students will be able to:  
 
• Design and implement a solution to a significant open-ended problem in software engineering. 
• Document and present (using written, oral and visual means) the design process and the results 
from a solution to a problem in software engineering. 
• Evaluate or assess a solution to a problem in software engineering, and compare with alternative 
approaches. 
• Discuss and evaluate their contribution to a team project. 
 
III. JUSTIFICATION 
 
This course provides a capstone design experience for students interested in software engineering.  
While previous courses in the Computer Science curriculum provide students with the knowledge 
and skills necessary to begin a career as a software engineer, the end-to-end design and 
implementation experience offered in this course, done as part of a team, and addressing an open-
ended problem, comes much closer to the experience that software engineering professionals 
encounter in the work place.   The emphasis on documentation and presentation of designs and 
results is also valuable career preparation, and forces students to take ownership of their designs 
and systems as they present them to others. 
 
This course is offered at the 4000 level because it requires a basic understanding of software 
design and software engineering principles and practice, as provided by the prerequisite (CS 3704, 
Intermediate Software Design and Engineering), and courses that are prerequisite to 3704. 
 
This revision updates the course topics to reflect current software engineering practice, and 
includes emphases appropriate to a capstone course.  The original course proposal was approved 
before Computer Science had a capstone requirement for its majors. 
 
IV. PREREQUISITES AND COREQUISITES 
 
Background in software design and software engineering, as taught in CS 3704 (Intermediate 
Software Design and Engineering) and its prerequisites, is essential for understanding and 
applying the advanced software engineering issues and practices that are integral to this course.
