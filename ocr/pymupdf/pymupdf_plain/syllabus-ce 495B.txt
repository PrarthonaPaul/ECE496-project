CE 495B 
CIVIL ENGINEERING DESIGN 
SPRING 2014 
 
CATALOG DESCRIPTION:  A capstone design experience using a team approach for the preliminary and 
final design of a Civil Engineering Project.  Documentation of all stages of the design project.  Written and oral 
presentation of the design project. 
 
PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE OF THE COURSE: 
 
The main objective of this course is to provide understanding of the basic concepts of planning, 
execution, and design of civil engineering projects to undergraduate students planning to pursue a career in any 
area of Civil Engineering. The purpose of the course is to give students an opportunity to: 
 
 Participate on a project design team, 
 Learn how to apply tools and procedures learned in other courses to a complete project, and  
 Understand how typical civil engineering projects progress from concept to final plans.

TEAM PROJECT 
 
 
The whole class will work in the teams which were formed during CE 495A. Each team will be required 
to completely design the project assigned in CE 495A. At the end of the semester, each team will submit a set of 
design plans and a project report which includes a complete set of calculations.  Also at the end of the semester, 
each team will orally present and defend its design. Oral presentations must be made with PowerPoint or other 
similar software.  
 
DELIVERABLES: 
Design Plans: A set of design plans must be prepared on 24x36 inch sheets and must be prepared using 
AutoCAD or equivalent software. As a minimum, the set should include: 
A cover sheet which includes at least the Project name, the Project location, an Index, and the names of 
the Team Members. 
 
A complete site plan along with topography of the area. 
 
General Notes, Schedules, and Specifications as required.  Reference Specifications should be identified 
 
here as well as in the design report. 
 
A plan of the project showing how various components of the project are laid out.  
 
Details (plans, profiles, sections, and detail drawings) necessary to complete the project. 
 
All sheets must be signed AND checked (initialed or signed by TWO team members) 
 
Final Report: The final report is the responsibility of the entire team and is not the sole responsibility of the 
project manager. However, the project manager will be responsible for compiling the final report. The final 
report should clearly indicate the name of the team member responsible for completing each task. As a 
minimum, the final report should include the following: 
 
 
       Final Report (continued) 
Title Page 
Cover Letter (a signed letter of transmittal for the plans and report) 
Table of Contents including Figures, Tables, and Appendices 
Executive Summary (this includes any changes from the accepted proposal and any recommendations  
for further or other work) 
Organizational Chart 
Project and Site Descriptions 
Scope of Work from the accepted proposal (any changes must also be noted here) 
List of required Permits 
Specifications including a list of Reference Specifications 
List of Engineering Standards (codes, handbooks, manuals, etc.) used  
Estimated Quantities and Costs 
 
 
The following items should be presented in appendices 
 
 
Responsibilities and Contributions of each team member 
 
 
Comparison of Estimated versus Actual Time Spent on the Project 
 
 
     Note:  Every team member should keep track of time spent on the project. The final   
 
 
 
    personnel expenditure for the design should be calculated based on the billable      
                                        rate for each category of work and time spent by each team member on each   
                                        category of work.  Time sheets or summaries should be included.   
 
 
 
            Minutes of Meetings (hand written or typed)  
 
 
     Note:  One person at each meeting should be assigned to take minutes of the meeting   
 
 
 
    and prepare the minutes to be distributed to other team members.  This can be a  
 
 
 
    different person each time.  The minutes should include the date, time, and place  
 
 
 
    of the meeting; the names of the people who are there; the items discussed; and  
 
 
 
 
    (especially) any decisions made at the meeting.  This is not a transcript.  
 
 
Design Calculations: signed AND checked (initialed or signed by TWO team members) 
 
 
Details that could not be included in the set of plans 
 
 
Resumes: updated and in team format

*This means what you have done at this point (current progress).  The Cover Sheet should be plotted at full 
scale on a 24" x 36" sheet.  Other sheets can be printed at reduced scale on letter size sheets. 
 
**These Presentations are meant to prepare you for final presentations and to identify items that may need 
improvement. These presentations will not be formal but must be presented in a professional manner even 
though they will not be graded.  The presentations will be given during the assigned class time or some other 
mutually convenient time. 
 
***All presentations will be made on April 29, 2014.  Each Team will have 30 minutes for its presentation. Each 
member will make part of the presentation.  It will be necessary for all of you to be present from 1:00 p.m. to 
4:30 p.m.  The presentations will be made to the Professional Advisory Board after their morning meeting and 
their luncheon (1:00 ~ 1:30).

GRADING POLICY: 
One of the objectives of the course is to help students understand how to successfully complete their portion of 
the project while working as a member of the design team. Therefore, your final grade will depend on your 
individual performance in completing your part of the project and your interpersonal relationships with other 
team members. The team members of each group will be asked to evaluate their teammates in order to assess 
each group member's contribution to the team and project.  Final grades will be calculated using the grading 
distribution and final grade assessment provided below.

Statement on Emergency Procedures: 
 
“Southern Illinois University Carbondale is committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for study 
and work.  Because some health and safety circumstances are beyond our control, we ask that you become 
familiar with the SIUC Emergency Response Plan and Building Emergency Response Team (BERT) program.  
Emergency response information is available on posters in buildings on campus, available on the BERT’s 
website at www.bert.siu.edu, Department of Public Safety’s website www.dps.siu.edu (disaster drop down), and 
in the Emergency Response Guidelines pamphlet.  Know how to respond to each type of emergency. 
 
Instructors will provide guidance and direction to students in the classroom in the event of an emergency 
affecting your location.  It is important that you follow these instructions and stay with your instructor during an 
evacuation or sheltering emergency.  The Building Emergency Response Team will provide assistance to your 
instructor in evacuating the building or sheltering within the facility.” 
 
 
  
Statement on Academic Honesty: 
 
It is essential that all of your work be your own.  All work that is not your own must be completely and properly 
referenced.  Note the Southern Illinois University Carbondale Student Conduct Code which is available in the 
current Catalog and can be found at www.siu.edu/~policies/policies/conduct.html.  Detailed descriptions can be 
found in Part A (Acts of Academic Dishonesty) of Section 2 (Violations).
