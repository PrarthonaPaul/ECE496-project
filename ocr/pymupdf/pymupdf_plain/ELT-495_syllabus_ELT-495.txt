BEFORE YOU START YOUR RESEARCH
One or more of the assignments in this course may involve original research. Research on
persons other than yourself may require approval by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)
of Thomas Edison State University prior to beginning your research. Examples of research
types that may need IRB review are questionnaires, surveys, passive observation of
individuals, interviews, and experimental procedures. Research involving vulnerable
populations will always need IRB review. An IRB review is designed to protect research
subjects from potential harm.
The following links fully explain the purpose of the Institutional Research Board as well as
how to determine if your research requires IRB review. If you are in doubt, always ask for
guidance from the University.

ASSESSMENT METHODS
For your formal work in the course, you are required to participate in six discussion forums
and complete three written assignments.
For your benefit in successfully completing the ELT-495 Capstone course keep the
following key points in mind – Student Outcomes and Course Calendar.
1. The final Capstone Project / Paper will be graded by how well you fulfill each of
the 12 Student Outcomes (SOs) denoted in the Course Rubric. It is imperative
that you construct your Project/Paper from the outset with this goal in mind.  The
capstone project research effort needs to encompass each element of the criteria
down to the sub-SO level where given, and the written report/research paper
needs to reflect unambiguous statements regarding student demonstration of
achievement and mastery of the EET SOs or sub-elements.  To effectively
demonstrate this linkage, you should list the ELT-495 Student Outcomes including
the sub-elements, as an Appendix of the final paper, and then note using
superscripts where each SO and sub-element is addressed within the body of
the paper.  Examples:  use (SO 4.b) or (SO 8.a) in the superscript font to indicate
where those sub-elements of the Student Outcomes are covered in the paper.  In
most cases it will be obvious within the context of the report where to reference
the associated outcome. However, in some cases it may seem odd to include text
in the body of the paper to address a specific SO, examples and suggestions
follow. The bottom line is that ALL SOs and sub-elements must be referenced in
the final Paper.
○ SO # 3 - “Demonstrate the ability to conduct standard tests and
measurements in the lab or in the field …”.  These sub-elements can be
referenced in the paper as you report on your results of assimilating data
and statistics.
○ SO # 5 - “Demonstrate effective leadership and participation as a
member of a technical team”.  These sub-elements should be described
and appropriately footnoted in the Introduction of the paper.
○ SO # 9 - “Demonstrate the need for and commitment to engage in self-
directed continuing professional development…”.  This SO can be
discussed and referenced in the Introduction or Conclusion of the paper.
 Consider including perspectives from each student.
○ SO # 12 - “Demonstrate a commitment to quality, timeliness, and
continuous improvement…”.  Each sub-element of this SO can be
discussed and appropriately footnoted in the Introduction or Conclusion of
the paper.
2. It is imperative that each student must complete all assignments of the course,
including Discussion Forums and Written Assignments.  If an individual does not
submit an assignment, they will not receive a passing grade for the course.
 Completion of all assignments is necessary for mentors to evaluate your
performance in all Student Outcomes and sub-elements designated for this
course.
3. The Course Calendar is available from the course main menu.  The Calendar
is available in pdf or Excel format.  The Course Calendar provides dates to start
4/14/24, 2:14 PM

each module and complete each assignment.  It is important to complete each
assignment before or by the due date to attain full credit.  To stay current with all
your assignments, I highly recommend that you maintain a copy of the Calendar
with the week-by-week dates on it. Submitting assignments late adversely impacts
your grades.
Promoting Originality
One or more of your course activities may utilize a tool designed to promote original work
and evaluate your submissions for plagiarism. More information about this tool is available
in this document.
Discussion Forums
This course requires you to participate in six graded discussion forums.

DF 2: TESU and ABET Program and Student Outcomes
DF 3: Teaming
DF 4: Final Team Problem Statement
DF 5: Oral Project Presentation
DF 6: Project Presentation; Discussion and Constructive Critique
 
The following Group Discussion Board forums are required but ungraded. They contribute
to your overall grade, however, because your mentor takes them into account when using
the ELT-495 Grading Rubric to assess your work in this course.
Team Forum 1: Research Methodology and Team Participation
Team Forum 2: Progress Report 1
Team Forum 3: Progress Report 2
 
Members of your team will also participate in other discussion forums at various points in
the course in order to complete course requirements.
 
Deadlines for posting discussion threads on the class Discussion Board are given in the
Course Calendar.
For posting guidelines and additional help with discussion board assignments please see
the Online Student Handbook located within the General Information section of the course
Web site.
Written Assignments
You are required to complete three written assignments. The written assignments are
steps in completing your final project paper, and in fact the last assignment is the project
paper itself. These formal written assignments are supplemented by the discussion forums
throughout the developmental stages of the project paper.
● WA 1: Problem Statement
● WA 2: Capstone Project Paper Outline
● WA 3: Final Capstone Project Paper
Before submitting your first assignment, check with your mentor to determine whether your
word processing software is compatible with your mentor's software. If so, you can submit

your work as you prepared it. If it is not compatible, save your assignment as a rich-text
(.rtf) file, using the Save As command of your software program. Rich text retains basic
formatting and can be read by any other word processing program.
Final Written Assignments need to be posted in the Gradebook and/or Class Discussion
Board only.  Use the Group Discussion Board and File Exchange as the locations to post
and critique draft documents.
See the Online Student Handbook for additional help regarding preparing and submitting
assignments located within the General Information section of the course website.
Final Capstone Project Paper
You are required to complete a final project as a group for this capstone course. The ability
to work effectively in a team is one of the program outcomes that each student should
achieve. This course requires students to form a group and work collaboratively to select a
final project topic and problem statement, research and identify the resources and
references, draft the paper, present the paper, and finalize and submit the final paper as a
group. The Groups area in this course provides you an online forum to discuss, share,
critique, and elaborate among your group members. It is also an online space for you to
demonstrate how well your group works together to complete your final paper.
Your final project includes five phases: select a problem statement, prepare a paper
outline with bibliography, complete two progress reports, post an oral presentation as a
video file, and submit the final paper. You are also required to post discussion comments
and constructive criticism of other students' oral presentations on discussion forums.
As part of your final paper grade, you are also required to rate your team members' efforts
in completing your final research paper. This will be an anonymous peer evaluation that
requires you to download and complete a group evaluation form in Module 6. The mentor
will average your peers' ratings, which will count toward 30 percent of your individual final
paper grade. The mentor's grading of your team's final paper counts toward 70 of your
individual final paper grade.
Your final paper should be 25 to 30 pages long excluding references and attachments. To
review a sample final project paper (not in this subject area), go to the Resources area of
the course site.
GRADING AND EVALUATION
Your grade in the course will be determined using the ELT-495 rubric. Be sure to review
each element of the Rubric to understand the criteria and details that will be used to
assess your final grade.  You will find this rubric in the Rubrics area of the course Web
site.
 
Key elements of the course that will be used to determine your final grade include:
