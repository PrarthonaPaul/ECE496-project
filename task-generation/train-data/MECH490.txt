MECH490 - Mechanical Engineering Capstone Project
University: Northern University of Technology
Course Duration: Full Year (Fall and Winter)
Instructor: Dr. Michael Brown
Contact Information: michael.brown@nut.edu
Office Hours: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM
Course Description
In this final-year capstone course, students apply their knowledge to a comprehensive design project. Projects may include designing a new mechanical device, improving an existing product, or developing a sustainable engineering solution. Students work in teams and are expected to produce a functional prototype.
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1.
Plan and manage a comprehensive engineering project.
2.
Conduct detailed design and analysis for mechanical systems.
3.
Develop and fabricate prototypes.
4.
Test and evaluate the performance of their designs.
5.
Communicate their design process and results effectively.
