Final Report
Capstone Project
Students are required to work on their senior design project, present their work progress on a regular basis,perform design demonstrations of their design, and submit a comprehensive fi nal report of their design by the end
of the course. Students will work in groups. The project design process includes problem statements, objectives,technical design specifi cations, component selections, design constraints, professional codes and standards, andproject management and implementation. This project should demonstrate the student’s ability to transfer theknowledge and skills acquired in their EDU courses to provide solutions for real-world applications.
Student Outcomes (ABET)
The EDU program must have documented student outcomes that support the program educational objectives.Attainment of these outcomes prepares graduates to enter the professional practice of engineering education.Student outcomes are outcomes (1) through (7), plus any additional outcomes that may be articulated by the EDUprogram. This course will assess the achievement of the following student outcomes:
1.
An ability to apply educational design to produce solutions that meet specifi ed needs with consideration ofpublic health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.
2.
An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.
3.
An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in educational situations and make informedjudgments, which must consider the impact of educational solutions in global, economic, environmental,and societal contexts.
4.
An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create acollaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.
5.
An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
