Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on the synthesis and characterization of novel organic compounds
with potential applications in pharmaceuticals or materials science. Students will design, synthesize,
and optimize an organic compound, culminating in a presentation of their findings at the Innovation
Showcase. The course includes the development of a project proposal, synthesis planning,
laboratory work, and a final report.
Course Objectives:
Design and synthesize a novel organic compound.
Characterize the compound using advanced techniques.
Optimize synthesis conditions for improved yield and purity.
Effectively present the project at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in organic synthesis and characterization techniques.
Develop practical skills in laboratory research and data analysis.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage complex chemistry projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve designing and synthesizing a novel organic compound
with potential applications in pharmaceuticals or materials science. The project will be broken down
into the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal detailing the objectives, the compound being synthesized, and the anticipated
impact. Include a timeline and assign roles to team members.
2. **Literature Review and Synthesis Planning (Weeks 4-6):**
- Conduct a thorough literature review to identify existing methods and gaps. Plan the synthesis
route, including reagents, conditions, and techniques.
3. **Synthesis and Characterization (Weeks 7-10):**
- Carry out the synthesis in the laboratory. Characterize the compound using techniques such as
NMR, IR, and mass spectrometry.
4. **Optimization and Yield Improvement (Weeks 11-12):**
- Optimize the synthesis conditions to improve yield and purity. Conduct additional tests to confirm
the structure and properties of the compound.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire synthesis process, including challenges, solutions, and outcomes in a final
report.
- Prepare a presentation and poster for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of
the project.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
