1. Calendar Information
In this project-based design course, teams of students will engage in the design and development of electric andhybrid vehicles. The course covers the fundamentals of electric and hybrid vehicle systems, including powertraindesign, battery technology, and energy management. Students will work on a comprehensive project to design,prototype, and test an electric or hybrid vehicle system.
2. Course Overview
AUTO450 is a capstone design project course intended to have students apply their knowledge of automotiveengineering to the design and development of electric and hybrid vehicles. Students will identify designchallenges, propose innovative solutions, and develop a working prototype. The course includes lectures, guestlectures from industry experts, hands-on practicums, and a student-driven design project.
The goal of this course is to provide students with the opportunity to practice engineering design skills within thecontext of electric and hybrid vehicles and to increase awareness of future technological advancements in theautomotive industry. Topics will include powertrain design, battery management systems, energy effi ciency, andvehicle dynamics.
3. Learning Outcomes and Graduate Attributes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1.
Identify and analyze the key components of electric and hybrid vehicle systems.
2.

8. Deliverables
All written submissions must be received by 11:59 PM on the date listed, with the exception of pre-classassignments which must be submitted before the start of class. Additional details related to each deliverable aregiven in guideline documents posted on the course platform.
Progress Presentations
Each progress presentation will consist of 1) three slides to show current work and 2)project management update. Presentation duties will be split and team members not presenting will be expected toanswer questions. Every member of each team must present twice and provide an answer at least twice.
Design Progress
Four team meetings will be scheduled approximately every three weeks with the projectsupervisor. The main purpose of these meetings is to review progress using each team’s project management boardto uncover problems and plan for future events. The discussions and decisions resulting from the board andtimeline review will be recorded in the meeting minutes and will be submitted to create a living document of yourprogress through your design project.
Pre-Class Assignments
The purpose of these short pre-class assignments (PCAs) is to prepare for a synchronousdiscussion during small and class-wide discussions held during lectures. Each assignment will be consideredcomplete by submitting it before the class has started or incomplete if submitted after the beginning of each classassociated with a PCA.
Project Requirements
Gathering information about your chosen problem and building an accurate understandingof your automotive-related need will allow you to defi ne what a design must do to be an acceptable solution. Yourteam is responsible for submitting a concise document that communicates the design requirements (specifi cations)of your stated need.
Project Proposal
Your team is responsible for drafting a project proposal document that: 1) defi nes the designproblem, 2) proposes possible solutions and selects the most promising design, and 3) provides a plan to carry outthe proposed solution.
Design Review and Critique
Each team will present an overview of their project and show preliminaryprototypes created so far. The aim of this presentation is to demonstrate your knowledge of the automotive needand the problem you have chosen to solve. The team will defend their design and key decisions with the aim to setyour team up for building a working prototype during the winter term.
Demonstration Day Presentation
Each team will present their design and demonstrate their fi nal workingprototype to the project supervisors and hopefully some of the users you have connected with as well. Considerthis presentation as a pitch to investors or a presentation at a design competition where you need to clearlycommunicate the need you are addressing and the problem you are offering a solution to.
Final Project Report
Your team must produce a fi nal report that provides enough information for someone todevelop your project further. While much of the project proposal can be reused, you are expected to incorporatefeedback from your project supervisors and fellow students to demonstrate you have iterated your original goals,ideas, concepts, designs, etc.
