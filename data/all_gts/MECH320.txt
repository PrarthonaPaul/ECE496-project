Offi ce Hours:
Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM
Course Description
In this third-year course, students apply thermodynamics and heat transfer principles to design and optimize athermal system, such as a heat exchanger or a refrigeration system. The course emphasizes hands-on experiencewith thermal system design, analysis, and optimization.
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1.
Apply thermodynamic principles to the design of thermal systems.
2.
Analyze heat transfer mechanisms and their impact on system performance.
3.
Optimize thermal systems for effi ciency and effectiveness.
4.
Conduct experimental validation and analysis of thermal systems.
5.
Communicate design concepts and results through written reports and oral presentations.
