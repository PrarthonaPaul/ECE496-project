3. Overview and Learning Outcomes
The course provides an opportunity for engineering students, with fourth year status, to demonstrate transfer of learning; through the integration and application of knowledge and skills acquired and developed over the course of the engineering program, to solve an open-ended practical (real world) problem. Spanning two academic terms, in this capstone project you will utilise the engineering design process to formulate a problem statement, define goals, objectives and constraints, generate possible solutions, select and assess a short-list of preferred alternative solutions, and, lastly, identify, develop and refine a preferred engineering design solution.
The capstone design project seeks to further develop and enhance your graduate attributes and professional skills. Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
• apply your engineering knowledge base and technical skills when solving engineering problems,
• utilize appropriate engineering methods and tools (e.g., experiment, analysis,) and apply critical thinking to reach substantiated conclusions that solve engineering problems,
• develop reliable engineered design solutions with confidence in predictable outcomes that integrate best practices, codes and standards,
• understand the significance and assess the interaction of factors (e.g. cultural, economic, environmental, societal, safety, sustainability, technical) that may impact the engineering design process or outcomes,
• develop an understanding of the roles and responsibilities of the engineering profession in society,
• apply engineering economics (e.g., capital, time value, depreciation), business practices (e.g., risk and change management), and engineering project management practices (e.g., scheduling, milestones, resource/time allocation, procurement), and
• develop and refine teamwork and communication skills (e.g., reading, writing, speaking, active listening) across all stakeholder backgrounds and perspectives (i.e., engineering profession, clients, public).
The Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) defines design as :”…an ability to design solutions for complex, open ended engineering problems and to design systems, components or processes that meet specified needs with appropriate attention to health and safety risks, applicable standards, and economic, environmental, cultural and societal considerations.”
As part of the CEAB accreditation process we will measure and assess graduate attributes (i.e., technical, professional and personal attributes) we seek to develop and refine throughout your undergraduate engineering program. The graduate attributes are evaluated using defined rubrics that are focused on teaching and learning outcomes. The graduate attribute assessment does not influence your grade assessment as defined in the course syllabus.

Table 4 Course Evaluation Notes:
1Although the course is centered around group activities, individual students will be assessed based on three performance indicators including (1) attendance, (2) individual performance, and (3) peer review.
Attendance (5% grade) will be recorded during lectures where the attendance grade component will be established at the end of the Winter semester. A Project Registry template is posted on the cuLearn course website site under Resources for your use (suggested but not mandatory). The Project Registry (or other documentation agreed upon by the project team and Project Supervisor) will be maintained by the Project Team Leader (or assigned project group member). The primary function of the Project Registry is to document action items, meeting objective and agenda, and highlight any constraint, delay or issue being confronted. After each group meeting or project review meeting, the Project Team Leader (or assigned project group member) will submit the Project Registry to the Project Supervisor (or assigned TA).
Individual performance (15% grade) measures the demonstrated level of active participation, engagement, and professionalism by an individual as part of a project team. The grade evaluations will be conducted at three milestones including the fall semester break, winter semester break and near the end of the winter semester using the same weighting (i.e., 5% each).

CIVE/ENVE 4918 – Course Syllabus Fall 2021 & Winter 2022 Page 8 of 12
The Project Supervisor will lead the evaluation and may integrate the assigned Teaching Assistant (TA) in the grading process. The primary information used to assess individual performance will be reported by each student through a description of how you have satisfied the competency metrics (see the Individual Performance Assessment template on the cuLearn course website site under General Information), which will be submitted as an appendix to each of the four Interim Reports and Final Report (see Notes 4,5,6). The Project Supervisor may incorporate feedback from external parties (e.g. TA, group peers, and mentors), and assess data recorded in the Project Registry.
The final (5% grade) component will be based on peer review (i.e., project team members evaluating other project team members through a confidential grading system), which will be conducted near the end of the winter semester.
In order to pass the course, each student must achieve greater than or equal to 30% of the 45% composite weighting for the two Individual Rating elements (i.e., Attendance & Performance) and two Presentation elements (i.e., Interim & Final Presentation). Failure to meet or exceed the 30% target will result in an assigned letter grade of F.
2Report guidelines are provided on the cuLearn course (under Conception, Feasibility, Design Basis, and Detailed Design folders). Although the reports are submitted as group deliverables, individual grades may be adjusted as warranted based on the Individual Performance Contributions (see Note 2). See §8 Group Selection on the project group selection process.
3Presentation guidelines and the grading rubric are posted on the cuLearn course site (under Presentations folder). The Interim Presentation will be presented to your Project Supervisor who may invite other external parties (e.g., TA, mentor, other Professors, external stakeholders such as industry, government, and municipalities). The Final presentation will be presented to a wider audience (e.g., Project Supervisor, TA, mentor, other Professors, external stakeholders such as industry, government, and municipalities).
4For e-mail correspondence (see also §10 Carleton University & Course Policies), please use the following format in your email subject line: 4918 Group # Subject Heading.
8. Group Selection
Students will form groups using the self-selection tool (see information posted on the cuLearn course website site under Task 1: Initiation) to create project teams. The project team self-selection should be completed as per the course milestones (see §6 Course Milestones). Each project team should have 6 team members. The Project Coordinators may have to re-organize project teams through re-distribution of individuals among different groups or assign individuals to groups.

9. CSCE National Capstone Design Competition
A National Capstone Design Competition is held during the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering (CSCE) Annual Conference. The competition is based on the CIVE/ENVE 4918 Design Project and is open to all senior undergraduate students in an accredited Canadian civil engineering program. Carleton University can nominate a single entry (team) for the national competition within any speciality area of the field (Structural, Construction, Geotechnical, Geomechanics, Hydraulics and Water Resources, Transportation or Environmental Engineering) for design projects completed during the current academic year. The National Capstone Design Competition provides an opportunity for two project team members to attend the CSCE Annual Conference and present their study (to peers, conference attendees and competition judges) in a poster session – it is uncertain what the format will be this year due to the effects of Covid-19.
Any project team that has an interest to participate in the CSCE National Capstone Design Competition, please contact the Course Coordinator (Dr. Shawn Kenny). If multiple teams are interested, then an internal competition will be required as each university can only nominate one entry.
10. Carleton University & Course Policies
