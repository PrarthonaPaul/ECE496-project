ECE482: Smart Grid Systems Design
Institution: Grand Bay Institute of Technology Term: Fall 2021 Instructor: Dr. Sarah Thompson Email: sthompson@gbtech.edu Office Location: Engineering Building, Room 218 Office Hours: Monday 2:00-4:00 PM, Wednesday 10:00 AM-12:00 PM Class Schedule: Tuesday & Thursday, 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM Classroom: Electrical Engineering Hall, Room 101
Course Description
ECE482: Smart Grid Systems Design is a senior-level, project-based course that focuses on the design and implementation of smart grid technologies. The course covers the integration of renewable energy sources, smart metering, demand response, and grid stability. Students will work in teams to develop a prototype of a smart grid system component, culminating in a final project presentation and demonstration.
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will:
1.
Understand the principles and components of smart grid systems, including renewable energy integration and smart metering.
2.
Design and implement a component of a smart grid system, considering technical, economic, and regulatory factors.
3.
Analyze the performance and stability of the smart grid under various operating conditions.
4.
Collaborate effectively in teams to develop and prototype a smart grid solution.
5.
Present technical designs and solutions clearly and effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Detailed Deliverables
1.
Proposal for Smart Grid Component (10%) Due: October 5, 2021 Teams will submit a proposal outlining their chosen smart grid component, including objectives, expected outcomes, and a project plan. The proposal should demonstrate the feasibility and relevance of the project within the context of smart grid systems.
2.
Preliminary Design Report (15%) Due: November 2, 2021 The preliminary design report should include detailed technical specifications, design diagrams, and a plan for prototyping. Teams will also identify potential challenges and propose solutions.
3.
Regulatory and Economic Impact Report (15%) Due: November 30, 2021 This report will assess the regulatory requirements and economic implications of the proposed smart grid component. Teams should consider compliance with standards, cost-benefit analysis, and potential market barriers.
4.
Final Design, Prototype, and Presentation (30%) Due: December 21, 2021 The final deliverable includes a fully developed design, a working prototype, and a formal presentation. The presentation will be delivered to a panel of industry professionals, faculty, and peers, focusing on the technical and practical aspects of the project.
5.
Peer Evaluation Report (10%) Due: December 21, 2021 Students will submit a peer evaluation report assessing the contributions of each team member. This report will help ensure that all team members are contributing equally and fairly to the project.
6.
Final Project Report (20%) Due: December 23, 2021 The final project report should document the entire design and development process, including the problem statement, design methodology, testing results, and conclusions. The report should also discuss future work and potential improvements.
