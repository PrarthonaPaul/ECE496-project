BEFORE YOU START YOUR RESEARCH
One or more of the assignments in this course may involve original research. Research onpersons other than yourself may require approval by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)of Thomas Edison State University prior to beginning your research. Examples of researchtypes that may need IRB review are questionnaires, surveys, passive observation ofindividuals, interviews, and experimental procedures. Research involving vulnerablepopulations will always need IRB review. An IRB review is designed to protect researchsubjects from potential harm.
The following links fully explain the purpose of the Institutional Research Board as well ashow to determine if your research requires IRB review. If you are in doubt, always ask forguidance from the University.

ASSESSMENT METHODS
For your formal work in the course, you are required to participate in six discussion forumsand complete three written assignments.
For your benefit in successfully completing the ELT-495 Capstone course keep thefollowing key points in mind –
Student Outcomes
and
Course Calendar
.
1.
The final Capstone Project / Paper will be graded by how well you fulfill each ofthe 12
Student Outcomes
(SOs) denoted in the
Course Rubric
. It is imperativethat you construct your Project/Paper from the outset with this goal in mind. Thecapstone project research effort needs to encompass each element of the criteriadown to the sub-SO level where given, and the written report/research paperneeds to reflect unambiguous statements regarding student demonstration ofachievement and mastery of the EET SOs or sub-elements. To effectivelydemonstrate this linkage, you should list the ELT-495 Student Outcomes includingthe sub-elements, as an
Appendix
of the final paper, and then
note usingsuperscripts
where each SO and sub-element is addressed within the body ofthe paper. Examples: use (SO 4.b) or (SO 8.a) in the superscript font to indicatewhere those sub-elements of the Student Outcomes are covered in the paper. Inmost cases it will be obvious within the context of the report where to referencethe associated outcome. However, in some cases it may seem odd to include textin the body of the paper to address a specific SO, examples and suggestionsfollow. The bottom line is that ALL SOs and sub-elements must be referenced inthe final Paper.
○
SO # 3 - “Demonstrate the ability to conduct standard tests andmeasurements in the lab or in the field …”. These sub-elements can bereferenced in the paper as you report on your results of assimilating dataand statistics.
○
SO # 5 - “Demonstrate effective leadership and participation as amember of a technical team”. These sub-elements should be describedand appropriately footnoted in the Introduction of the paper.
○
SO # 9 - “Demonstrate the need for and commitment to engage in self-directed continuing professional development…”. This SO can bediscussed and referenced in the Introduction or Conclusion of the paper. Consider including perspectives from each student.
○
SO # 12 - “Demonstrate a commitment to quality, timeliness, andcontinuous improvement…”. Each sub-element of this SO can bediscussed and appropriately footnoted in the Introduction or Conclusion ofthe paper.
2.
It is imperative that each student must complete all assignments of the course,including Discussion Forums and Written Assignments. If an individual does notsubmit an assignment, they will not receive a passing grade for the course. Completion of all assignments is necessary for mentors to evaluate yourperformance in all
Student Outcomes
and sub-elements designated for thiscourse.
3.
The
Course Calendar
is available from the course main menu. The Calendaris available in pdf or Excel format. The Course Calendar provides dates to start

each module and complete each assignment. It is important to complete eachassignment before or by the due date to attain full credit. To stay current with allyour assignments, I highly recommend that you maintain a copy of the Calendarwith the week-by-week dates on it. Submitting assignments late adversely impactsyour grades.
Promoting Originality

Team Forum 2: Progress Report 1
Team Forum 3: Progress Report 2
Members of your team will also participate in other discussion forums at various points inthe course in order to complete course requirements.
Deadlines for posting discussion threads on the class Discussion Board are given in theCourse Calendar.
For posting guidelines and additional help with discussion board assignments please seethe Online Student Handbook located within the General Information section of the courseWeb site.
Written Assignments
You are required to complete three written assignments. The written assignments aresteps in completing your final project paper, and in fact the last assignment is the projectpaper itself. These formal written assignments are supplemented by the discussion forumsthroughout the developmental stages of the project paper.

WA 1: Problem Statement
●
WA 2: Capstone Project Paper Outline
●
WA 3: Final Capstone Project Paper
Before submitting your first assignment, check with your mentor to determine whether yourword processing software is compatible with your mentor's software. If so, you can submit

your work as you prepared it. If it is not compatible, save your assignment as a rich-text(.rtf) file, using the Save As command of your software program. Rich text retains basicformatting and can be read by any other word processing program.
Final Written Assignments need to be posted in the Gradebook and/or Class DiscussionBoard only. Use the Group Discussion Board and File Exchange as the locations to postand critique draft documents.
See the Online Student Handbook for additional help regarding preparing and submittingassignments located within the General Information section of the course website.
Final Capstone Project Paper
You are required to complete a final project as a group for this capstone course. The abilityto work effectively in a team is one of the program outcomes that each student shouldachieve. This course requires students to form a group and work collaboratively to select afinal project topic and problem statement, research and identify the resources andreferences, draft the paper, present the paper, and finalize and submit the final paper as agroup. The Groups area in this course provides you an online forum to discuss, share,critique, and elaborate among your group members. It is also an online space for you todemonstrate how well your group works together to complete your final paper.
Your final project includes five phases: select a problem statement, prepare a paperoutline with bibliography, complete two progress reports, post an oral presentation as avideo file, and submit the final paper. You are also required to post discussion commentsand constructive criticism of other students' oral presentations on discussion forums.
As part of your final paper grade, you are also required to rate your team members' effortsin completing your final research paper. This will be an anonymous peer evaluation thatrequires you to download and complete a group evaluation form in Module 6. The mentorwill average your peers' ratings, which will count toward 30 percent of your individual finalpaper grade. The mentor's grading of your team's final paper counts toward 70 of yourindividual final paper grade.
Your final paper should be 25 to 30 pages long excluding references and attachments. Toreview a sample final project paper (not in this subject area), go to the Resources area ofthe course site.
GRADING AND EVALUATION
Your grade in the course will be determined using the ELT-495 rubric. Be sure to revieweach element of the Rubric to understand the criteria and details that will be used toassess your final grade. You will find this rubric in the Rubrics area of the course Website.
