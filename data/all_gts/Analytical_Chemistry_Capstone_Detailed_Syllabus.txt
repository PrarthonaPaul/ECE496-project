Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on the development and validation of analytical methods for detecting
and quantifying specific compounds in complex matrices. Students will design, validate, and apply
an analytical method, culminating in a presentation of their findings at the Innovation Showcase. The
course includes the development of a project proposal, method development, validation, and a final
report.
Course Objectives:
Design and validate an analytical method for detecting and quantifying compounds.
Apply the method to real-world samples and analyze the data.
Compare the method's performance with standard methods.
Effectively present the project at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in analytical method development and validation.
Develop practical skills in laboratory research and data analysis.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage chemistry projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve the development and validation of an analytical method
for detecting and quantifying a specific compound in a complex matrix. The project will be broken
down into the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal detailing the objectives, the compound of interest, and the anticipated impact.
Include a timeline and assign roles to team members.
2. **Literature Review and Method Development (Weeks 4-6):**
- Conduct a thorough literature review to identify existing methods. Develop a new or improved
analytical method, including the selection of instrumentation and conditions.
3. **Method Validation (Weeks 7-10):**
- Validate the method by testing its accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity. Compare the
results with standard methods and make necessary adjustments.
4. **Application and Data Analysis (Weeks 11-12):**
- Apply the validated method to real-world samples. Analyze the data to quantify the compound of
interest and assess the method's reliability.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire method development and validation process, including challenges,
solutions, and outcomes in a final report.
- Prepare a presentation and poster for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of
the project.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
