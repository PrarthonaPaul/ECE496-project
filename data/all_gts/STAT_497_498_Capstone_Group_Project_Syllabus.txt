2. Developing hypotheses and statistical models to address the problem.
3. Collecting and analyzing data using advanced statistical techniques.
4. Implementing and testing models or methods.
5. Evaluating the results based on statistical criteria.
6. Documenting and presenting findings.
7. Managing the project to ensure timely completion and high-quality deliverables.
Course-Specific Learning Outcomes:
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Work with sponsors to define a statistical problem and develop a research plan.
2. Design and implement appropriate statistical methods and models.
3. Analyze data and evaluate model performance using statistical measures.
4. Manage project resources effectively to meet deadlines and goals.
5. Address ethical issues related to data privacy, bias, and reporting.
6. Communicate results through written reports and oral presentations.
7. Function effectively within a team to produce a comprehensive statistical analysis.
