Course Description:
This capstone course focuses on the detection and characterization of exoplanets. Students will
analyze data from telescopes to detect exoplanets and characterize their properties, culminating in a
presentation of their findings at the Innovation Showcase. The course includes the development of a
project proposal, data collection, modeling, and a final report.
Course Objectives:
Detect and characterize exoplanets using observational data.
Develop models to understand exoplanetary atmospheres and compositions.
Compare observational data with theoretical predictions.
Effectively present the project at the Innovation Showcase.
Learning Outcomes:
Gain expertise in exoplanetary science and data analysis.
Develop practical skills in modeling and hypothesis testing.
Improve communication skills through written reports and presentations.
Enhance the ability to manage astronomy projects from conception to completion.
Group Project and Required Subtasks:
The group project for this course will involve the detection and characterization of exoplanets. The
project will be broken down into the following subtasks:
1. **Project Proposal (Week 3):**
- Create a proposal detailing the objectives, the specific exoplanets or planetary systems being
studied, and the anticipated outcomes. Include a timeline and assign roles to team members.
2. **Data Collection and Analysis (Weeks 4-6):**
- Collect data from space telescopes and ground-based observatories. Analyze the light curves
and radial velocity data to detect exoplanets.
3. **Characterization and Modeling (Weeks 7-10):**
- Characterize the detected exoplanets by modeling their atmospheres, compositions, and
potential habitability. Compare the models with observational data.
4. **Interpretation and Hypothesis Testing (Weeks 11-12):**
- Interpret the results of the data analysis and test hypotheses about the formation and evolution
of exoplanets.
5. **Final Report and Presentation (Weeks 13-15):**
- Document the entire research process, including challenges, solutions, and outcomes in a final
report.
- Prepare a presentation and poster for the Innovation Showcase that highlights the key aspects of
the project.
Groups are expected to collaborate closely, meeting regularly to discuss progress and resolve any
issues. Instructor check-ins will be scheduled to provide guidance and feedback.
