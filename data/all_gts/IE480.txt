Objective:
The objective of the course is to provide you with “real-world” industry project experience. You will
learn how to work effectively in teams, develop your ability to communicate (oral and written),
develop project planning and management skills, and solve a real problem of importance to your
sponsor.
Professional Conduct:
You are expected to conduct yourself with the utmost personal and professional integrity during all
project activities and business. Your overall performance in the class will be evaluated and your
professional conduct is an important component of that evaluation. You must strive to complete all
your work with responsibility, honesty and loyalty. As a student in this Capstone Design Project
Course you are representing yourself as a professional in the field of engineering and you are also
representing The Harold and Inge Marcus Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering at
The Pennsylvania State University.
Content:
In this course as in industry, your ability to communicate your ideas is very important and will be
carefully assessed. You will be writing and presenting a formal project proposal, an interim report on
your progress, and a final project report. You will also be writing weekly progress memos to capture
your ongoing work and participating in weekly conference calls with your project sponsor. These
means of communicating your work are described below.
2
Weekly Progress Memo: A weekly memo to the sponsor will be written and turned in to your advisor
by 7:00 a.m. each Monday. This memo should follow the Weekly Progress Report Template available
on ANGEL under Lessons. You will also schedule a weekly meeting with your advisor and a weekly
conference call with your project sponsor.
Project Proposal: The proposal is due to your advisor on 09/20. An in-class presentation of the
proposal is required (scheduled times will be determined). This proposal and its presentation will
provide 1) identification and definition of the problem; 2) background on the company, current
design/system, etc.; 3) proposed methodology and approach with appropriate measures and metrics;
4) project management including Gantt charts of activities; and 5) anticipated results and deliverables.
The proposal will follow Proposal Report Guidelines that will be supplied by your faculty mentor.
Interim Progress Report: A major progress report is due to your advisor on 10/18. The progress
report should: 1) review the problem definition, current product/system/service, and proposed
solution methodology; 2) show progress to date; review progress from a project management (timing)
standpoint, 3) noting any future changes in project timing; and 4) indicate the work remaining and
anticipated changes in direction. Follow Interim Report Guidelines that will be supplied by your
faculty mentor.
Final Report and Showcase: The final report is due to your advisor on 12/04, and it will follow Final
Report Guidelines that will be supplied by your faculty mentor.
An in-class presentation based on the final report is required (scheduled times will be determined).
You will prepare a one-page project recap summary and a poster. The entire team is expected to
attend the Project Showcase to present your poster on 12/13 subject to class conflicts. You will
schedule and make a final project presentation to your sponsor by 12/13 and deliver a printed final
report to your sponsor no later than 12/14.
For each of the above components, you will be turning in the deliverables to your advisor and this version
(Version 1) will be graded. Your advisor will make comments and corrections that you must address in a
revised version (Version 2) then submit to your sponsor.
It is also important that you learn to be an effective participant in a team setting. Your participation and
team contributions will be assessed as indicated below.
Participation and Peer/Sponsor Evaluation: Participation and attendance is an important portion of
this course. At the beginning of the semester, in-class time will be used to provide professional
background and orientation that will be helpful for your projects. Later, some in-class time will be
used for project presentations and discussion. You are expected to be in class for background sessions
and project presentations unless there is a pre-approved extenuating circumstance.
Part of this course also covers your ability to function effectively as part of a team. You will be asked
to evaluate your team members throughout the semester. Your Company Sponsor will also provide an
evaluation of each individual team member. These peer and sponsor evaluations will be used as part
of your grade for the course.
A final component of this course is to impart an understanding of ethical responsibilities. An ethics video
will be shown on 09/04 with an assignment that will assess your understanding of the concepts presented
in the video and the relationship to the Code of Ethics for Engineers. Further instructions will be
distributed separately.

ABET 2000 Outcomes:
􀀀 3.1 - Present engineering study results in technical reports and orally. 
􀀀 3.2 - Demonstrate independent learning by synthesizing information from several sources. 
􀀀 4.1 - Work effectively in groups on case studies/projects. 
􀀀 4.3 – Understand professional and ethical responsibilities 
􀀀 1.6 –Design a system, component or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as
economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability and
sustainability. 
Grading:
Weekly Project Updates 10%
Project Proposal Deliverables 20%
Interim Progress Deliverables 10%
Participation/ Peer/Sponsor Evaluations 15%
Ethics Assignment 05%
Final Deliverables 30%
Meeting Sponsor’s Project Objective 10%
100%
A grade of “Incomplete” will be assigned to teams until they submit all final deliverables to the project
sponsor and the Learning Factory.
Late submission of intermediate deliverables will result in a reduced grade for that deliverable.
The above grading scale applies to team members who make significant and sustained contributions to
the team’s technical work, to the team’s project management, and to the team’s deliverables. A team
member who fails to contribute in all of these areas harms the team’s final product, and his or her grade
will be penalized accordingly.
Disabilities:
“Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational programs. If you have a
disability-related need for reasonable academic adjustments in this course, contact the Office for
Disability Services (ODS) at 814-863-1807 (V/TTY). For further information regarding ODS, please
